We developed The Brand Amplifiers after noticing that many entrepreneurs in women-owned, veteran owed, or Black-owned communities did not have access to the tools and information that help create compelling brands.   When we started with our daughter as our first official client back in 2007, we had no idea how much time, energy, and resources were required to properly create a memorable, well-respected, and impactful brand. However, we were intentional and focused and turned our 6-year-old DJ daughter into a recognizable powerhouse. Our work landed her clients like the Obama family, ESSENCE, T-Mobile, Lufthansa Airlines, McDonald's, MTV, BET, VH1, The National Women's Soccer Team, Abercrombie & Fitch, Smithsonian, and the list goes on and on.  Fast forward, our agency has gone from branding a child entertainer to branding companies in tech, the non-profit sector, law, beauty and wellness, business & relationship coaching, natural medicine, spiritual gurus, design thinking, social media platforms, and mobile applications.

 The Brand Amplifiers is happy to provide consultant services in the following areas: - Choosing a business name - Understanding your audience - Writing a compelling brand story - Messaging - Creating/choosing your brand assets for marketing - Creating your brand strategy - Creating your brand's Identity - The steps to organizing a successful brand photoshoot - How to build and use the necessary assets for your brand website - How to use your brand assets to create social media posts that resonate with your audience - Content Creation - Brand Copy - Email Marketing
