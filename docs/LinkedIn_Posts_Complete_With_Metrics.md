**Full Content:**

Last year, Sally Steele and I co-founded Outdoorithm, a social enterprise that combines our love for the outdoors with a touch of tech nerdiness to make camping more accessible for families. We've spent years with our four girls exploring and overcoming the barriers that often keep people from enjoying nature, and now we're sharing what we've learned to help others do the same.

Outdoorithm is our way of "hacking" camping for first-timers—giving them the tools and confidence they need to dive into the outdoors. Whether it's figuring out where to go, how to get there, or what to bring, we've got you covered.

We've also just filed paperwork to establish a sister nonprofit, Outdoorithm Collective, dedicated to organizing group trips for urban families, further expanding our mission to bring more underrepresented folks into nature.

🌟 Check Out Our Deck: A comment we often hear is, "I've never been camping and don't know where to start", so we put together this first version of "Master the Art of Camping," which offers essential tips and insights to help families get started.

If you haven't camped much (or at all), we'd love to hear:

- Which part of the presentation did you find most helpful in building your confidence to go camping?
- What resources or support would make you feel more prepared and comfortable about planning your first camping trip?

If you're already an experienced camper, what do you love most about camping?!

Red-eye flight, midnight Friday SFO arrival, and a text message from Sally that threatened to blow up our Labor Day plans: "I just tested positive for COVID." With immunocompromised parents arriving soon, our long-planned camping trip to Nevada Beach - recently named the hardest-to-book campground in the country - was in jeopardy.

Solo parent four kids at Lake Tahoe? Challenge accepted. Outdoorithm packing list, pep talk (kids were... somewhat helpful), and we hit the road.

Labor Day weekend was one for the books. Tough for sure, but it was the perfect mental reset before my Google.org keynote at our first ever Global Impact Summit this week, even if it meant finishing my speech at midnight Monday 😛

Sally's new blog post reveals how we scored TWO campsites at Nevada Beach. Whether you're a seasoned camper or just starting out, I hope her tips will inspire your next adventure.

**Full Content:**

After ten impactful years at Google, the time has come to step into my next chapter. As part of Google.org's recent reorganization, this week is my last.

It's been a profound privilege to serve communities that deserve our very best. Reflecting on the journey, I'm struck by the moments that defined our work: responding to the Charleston Church shooting or George Floyd's murder by partnering with organizations like The Movement for Black Lives and Center for Policing Equity to support communities impacted by racial injustice; partnering with Equal Justice Initiative to bring the Lynching in America project to life; and launching the Google Career Certificates Fund with Social Finance to drive $1 billion in wage gains for American job seekers. Each initiative required us to embrace tension—being bold and measured, innovative and pragmatic, revolutionary and stabilizing.

As I explore new opportunities in social impact and justice, I remain deeply committed to advancing these values. If you know of organizations aligned with this work or opportunities in roles like Chief Impact Officer, I'd love to connect.

I am also excited to continue dedicating time to building Outdoorithm, the social enterprise I co-founded with Sally Steele. Outdoorithm leverages AI to make camping on public lands more accessible, offering tools that simplify trip planning and make camping more welcoming. Its sister nonprofit, Outdoorithm Collective, focuses on guided group camping trips for urban families of color, turning public lands into spaces for healing, connection, and empowerment.

This past weekend, I was reminded of the power of nature and community while participating in a transformative Boyz N The Wood expedition to Big Bend National Park guided by Black Outside, Inc. Under the West Texas sun and night skies filled with stars, we hiked, reflected, and connected. I shared my own story of navigating tough transitions and was supported by an amazing group of brothers.

Nature is a space of healing, especially when experienced in community. I am inspired by and grateful for Boyz N The Wood's mission of helping Black men restore and reignite the best versions of themselves through the outdoors. At Outdoorithm, we work in solidarity towards this vision.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of my journey. I'm excited for what's next and for continuing this shared mission to create belonging, empowerment, and healing in all the spaces we inhabit—whether indoors or out.

"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced." - James Baldwin

Baldwin's words have been a constant companion over the last two decades leading corporate social impact—including directing over half a billion dollars in philanthropy—and they resonate even more deeply today as I reflect on the journey and look towards what's next.

I'm sharing some hard-earned truths about navigating the tensions between profit and purpose. For those doing this work: you have more power than you think. Use it wisely. Use it bravely.

I'm excited to announce my next chapter as Founder & Fractional Chief Impact Officer at True Steele LLC!

After two decades helping organizations drive both impact and growth - from Bain & Company/The Bridgespan Group to Year Up United to Google.org - I'm bringing everything I've learned to more organizations - not as a consultant, but as a part-time executive partner building lasting change (I'll also reserve a little capacity for one-off advisory).

As an embedded executive role, I'll only have capacity to work with a small handful of organizations. I've been humbled by the outreach since leaving Google, and I'm excited to build and innovate together with a few of you.

The world needs more organizations successfully balancing purpose and performance. I'm thrilled to help make that happen.

Sharing the story because it's wild what's possible now with AI as your coding partner. From problem to solution in 4 hours!

When tech doesn't serve everyone equally, we can build our own solutions. Now off to Yosemite with 30 folks in the Outdoorithm Collective family to test it out in real life! ⛺️❄️

How do you break into Corporate Social Responsibility?

After a decade leading social impact initiatives at major tech companies, I've observed that most CSR roles are never publicly advertised, and staff turnover remains exceptionally low.

Despite these barriers, viable pathways exist, whether approaching opportunities internally or externally. I outline five distinct routes with practical insights from someone who's been in the seat.

The key is finding people energized by this balancing act who view corporate resources as levers for change and demonstrate patience and proactivity.

[Reshare with commentary]

Kavell is a "gate-opener" helping others find alternative entry routes into the field. We both released complementary pieces the same day.

*Original post by Kavell Brown addresses the primary question he receives: transitioning into CSR/Social Impact roles. He emphasizes rejecting gatekeeping mentality, acknowledging that success in this space involves privilege and luck rather than pure merit. The field is intentionally and unintentionally exclusive. A negative feedback loop exists: positions require experience candidates cannot obtain. In 2025, Brown is democratizing access through an informal meeting for BIPOC individuals.*

Wow, REI just announced the sunset of its Experiences division after 40 years - ending programs that helped nearly one million people build confidence in the outdoors. My heart goes out to the 400+ guides and staff impacted by this decision. Having experienced corporate restructuring firsthand, I know how challenging these transitions can be.

This a sobering reminder: markets alone can't solve every social challenge, especially when it comes to equity and access.

Community-led organizations are stepping up to fill the gap.

While we're doing our part at Outdoorithm Collective providing free camping trips for urban families, my partner and co-founder Sally Steele spotlights an incredible network of leaders creating authentic, culturally-rich outdoor experiences. From Black Outside Inc's youth programs to Camp Yoshi's culinary adventures, these initiatives go beyond just getting outside - they're building belonging, healing generational trauma, and rewriting narratives about who gets to feel at home in nature.

Read Sally's post below to discover these visionary organizations. If you're serious about mental health, community wellness, and representation in the outdoors, these are leaders worth supporting.

Meta announced today it's ending its DEI programs in favor of "serving everyone." But I keep mulling over this question in my mind:

Are America's most powerful companies sleepwalking away from the hard work of confronting how power and privilege actually work in our society, while dreaming of universal fairness? Or is this simply what institutional retreat looks like when faced with political pressure?

I wonder what it would mean to stay awake to these questions, even when – especially when – it feels easier to drift back to sleep.

Excited to see Google.org's cybersecurity clinics fund recognized as an "Ecosystem Champion" finalist by Institute for Security and Technology (IST). But beyond the accolade, a deeper question lingers—one we wrestled with as we built this program: What does it take to truly democratize power and protection?

In 2023, we focused on building capacity where it's needed most—not where it's easiest or most headline-worthy. At Tougaloo College, students are defending local churches and healthcare providers in Black communities. At Turtle Mountain Community College, students are protecting tribal schools and critical infrastructure for the Chippewa Nation. In rural South Carolina, Trident Technical College is training student defenders to safeguard nonprofits and small businesses.

These 25 clinics across 18 states remind us that "equity isn't about 'serving everyone' as rhetoric—it's about staying awake to the realities of power and access." Who benefits? Who's excluded? And how can we ensure every community thrives in a digital world?

Grateful to Ann C., Tatyana B., Maab Ibrahim, and the growing consortium for showing what's possible when intention guides impact.

More to come on cultivating social change in tough corporate soil—follow along for that conversation.

Shared appreciation for how Wildseeds Fund transformed four foundational values from my article into shareable wisdom. "How we build matters as much as what we build."

- LOVE: A force for transformation, not merely an emotion
- POWER: Protection and sustenance of change, not domination
- TRUTH: A foundation rather than a weapon
- SOLIDARITY: Deep practice of shared struggle beyond rhetoric

The visual interpretation added dimension to these principles. Thanks to the organization for sharing them as "love notes" to the community.

If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would you invite?

We've all heard this question at countless icebreakers. But imagine if you could actually hear your intellectual heroes engage your ideas.

That's exactly what happened to me after finishing the final draft of my latest article, "The Reformer's Dilemma." I wanted to know: What if Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, James Baldwin, and others could critique my work directly?

Using AI—not to write for me, but to challenge my thinking—I jumped over to Claude and entered a simple prompt:

"You are [scholar name]. You've been hired by the New York Times to write a reaction to my article below. Please write your reaction."

I literally jumped out of my chair at the results:

- Ta-Nehisi Coates cut straight to the heart of my metaphor about institutions being "houses built before we arrived," reminding me "these houses were not merely built before we arrived – they were built upon our backs, their very foundations mixed with the blood and sweat of enslaved people."

- James Baldwin pushed me to question why we need the approval of corporate power at all, asking: "Why must the horror of lynching be filtered through the lens of corporate responsibility to become palatable to America?"

- bell hooks urged a complete reimagining of power: "True power lies not in our capacity to sustain change within existing systems, but in our ability to imagine and create entirely new ways of being in community."

Of course, this works best if you already know their writing. AI models pull from vast amounts of content, often without direct consent. That's why I encourage everyone to purchase and engage with these scholars' actual work—no AI can replace the depth and power of their original writing.

That said, these tools exist, and they will be used—for better or worse. If they're here to stay, let's use them with intention—to push our thinking, sharpen our ideas, and advance work that truly matters.

What intellectual giants would you want critiquing your ideas? Drop a name below—or, better yet, try the prompt on something you're working on!

🔥 Greg's post is fire! I've been developing with AI for 18 months (and watching it for the last decade at Google), but NOW is the moment everything changes.

"we're about to go from 'there's an app for that' to 'there's your app for that'"

When weather apps failed our Outdoorithm group camping trips, I built my own app in half a day (https://lnkd.in/edmvQH92). But that's nothing compared to what's coming.

"what used to require millions in vc funding now needs an api key, some prompts and a tweet."

I just spent the last week creating an AI nonprofit funder prospecting tool that's REVOLUTIONIZING how I find funding for Outdoorithm Collective. It embodies potential funders (I would know, I gave half a billion dollars away as a funder), evaluates alignment with our mission and values, and delivers a curated list of perfect matches complete with a custom pitch.

I'm already booking meetings with funders. No more years of tedious prospecting. No more shooting in the dark. This is the future happening NOW. Curious about this tool? DM me!

"i dont understand anyone who sitting in business school right now. literally everything is being rewritten."

Same for folks inside companies. Too much of the soil inside our major economic and political institutions is depleted for growing new, revolutionary things. The soil has never been more fertile out here in the greenfield.

The revolution is here—who's ready to build?

"The comfortable leader is no leader at all." Standing backstage at Google's TGIF with Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 2016, I faced a pivotal moment: Would introducing Bryan Stevenson and his message on justice help our company grow its capacity for impact—or divide it?

The most transformative leadership moments aren't comfortable. They demand courage.

In my new article, I explore:
- Why the root of leadership is risk
- How to manage the "thermostat of change"
- When discomfort signals you're on the right (or wrong) path
- Four practical approaches to leading through complexity

What's been your most uncomfortable leadership decision that ultimately created the greatest impact?

**Full Content:**

If nonprofits don't harness AI, others will—shaping outcomes without our values or communities in mind.

I co-founded Outdoorithm as a for-profit social enterprise because I doubted nonprofit funding would scale to meet the demands of running an AI-powered social impact platform.

After years leading nonprofits and directing grantmaking at Google.org, I've repeatedly watched funders hesitate to make the sustained infrastructure and talent investments that great technology requires.

In my final days at Google.org, I even surprised myself by advocating more strongly for social enterprise investment—not because I stopped believing in nonprofits, but because philanthropy seemed unprepared to scale AI innovation.

Project Evident's latest report, Funding the Future: Grantmaker Strategies in AI Investment, underscores this reality:

- Only 36% of funders feel confident evaluating the technical feasibility of AI implementation. Ethical assessments? Even murkier. This uncertainty stalls essential innovation.
- "Philanthropy has a poor history of supporting ongoing technology investment." AI isn't a one-time project—it's core infrastructure. Without a shift, nonprofits will fall behind.
- Funders regularly resist investments in operational efficiency driven by tech, even though efficiency exponentially amplifies social impact.

I'm building new things with AI every single day, and I'm constantly blown away by what these tools can do and how fast they're evolving.

For example, one app I created for myself and am now working with friends to turn into something others can use creates dynamic AI-driven foundation funder personas that instantly filter out thousands of poor-fit funding prospects. It then strategically coaches nonprofits on exactly how to approach the top prospects. Curious? DM me—I'd love to include you on our early-access list.

I'm still leading a nonprofit (hey Outdoorithm Collective). I deeply believe in nonprofits. But unless philanthropy shifts its mindset, nonprofits won't lead the AI revolution—they'll follow.

**Full Content:**

I'm thrilled to join Coding Temple as fractional Chief Impact Officer! Having co-created the $100M Google Career Certificates Fund, I'm excited to continue tackling a challenge that's been central to my work for two decades: closing the opportunity divide that keeps talented people from accessing pathways to economic mobility.

Here's why I'm especially excited to be partnered with Coding Temple: Each year, 9,000+ individuals—78% from underrepresented backgrounds—pass our rigorous technical assessments but can't enroll. Why? Because traditional high-interest financing doesn't work for most students—especially those from overlooked communities.

And that's frustrating because Coding Temple graduates achieve strong, consistent outcomes:
• 85% job placement rate for active job seekers
• $70-80K average starting salaries
• Economic mobility in months, not years

There's a tension here that I find both challenging and energizing. We have thousands of talented people ready to transform their lives, proven outcomes that demonstrate success, and yet a financing system that stands in the way.

For me, the question isn't if we can build a breakthrough funding structure, but how. Is it:
• A "pay it forward" fund where graduates contribute modest payments after securing employment?
• A philanthropic scholarship model targeting specific underserved communities?
• An employer-sponsored pipeline with direct hiring commitments?
• Something entirely new that bridges public, private and philanthropic capital?

If you're a funder, employer, or innovator grappling with these same challenges, DM me! I'm confident we're going to create something powerful here. By solving this at the organizational level, we have a chance to create a model that others can replicate without requiring a Google-sized balance sheet.

Reflections on integrating Christian faith with professional leadership. Navigating "tough business meetings—debates over justice funding, sharp board-room questions" while asking whether organizations can "do the right thing and still hit the numbers."

This extends beyond faith-specific audiences: "whatever your deepest convictions—faith-based, humanist, or otherwise," values and financial performance can align when leaders integrate rather than compartmentalize them.

Three practical habits enabling leaders to maintain core beliefs while delivering measurable results, drawing on examples where data initially pushed toward "safer" approaches but the organization stayed true to its mission instead.

Love how Sally Steele captured our Memorial Day weekend group camping trip and our new mantra. What made "camp as it comes" work with 40 new campers from urban families was embracing the beautiful chaos together.

When temps dropped to the 40s, we fired up propane heaters for chilly folks. When the kiddos got in their feelings after long days, we co-parented and helped them find their calm. Our teenagers became raccoon patrol when the bandits started rolling deep.

We also had mornings cooking 60 pancakes together, passing baby carriers to each other through tight cave passageways, and raising a dozen kiddos as a village. We camped as it came. And it was beautiful.

*[Shared Sally Steele's original post describing a challenging camping trip to Pinnacles National Park where the family arrived late at night with sick children but embraced the "camp as it comes" philosophy. Despite initial obstacles including a child's illness requiring cleanup at 1:30 AM, the weekend involved 40 urban families bonding together.]*

Anthropic's CEO just warned that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years. As someone who's spent the last two years building AI tools, I believe him.

To me, the question isn't whether AI will displace jobs, it's whether we'll allow a handful of owners to capture and keep all the value. Let's not fool ourselves into thinking the market will choose generosity. But is there a narrow window where those closest to real problems could become the architects of solutions?

That's why I'm co-founding and building Kindora and Outdoorithm—not because I have this figured out, but because I can't stand waiting for others to decide our fate. The game is being completely reimagined as we speak. AI is upending everything. Do we wait for the new rules to settle into another version of the same hierarchies, or do we get in there while they're still being written?

I felt the need to create something where I can choose how the winnings get shared, where my daughters have a shot at ownership instead of trying to climb corporate ladders whose bottom rungs have been cut away. Maybe I'm naive, but I'd rather try to build a different kind of table than fight for better seats at the old one.

What would it mean to stop waiting for others to design the future we want to live in, and start building it ourselves, before the window closes?

Just read Benevity's new report: 88% of corporate impact leaders now frame their work as "future‑proofing the business."

Then came two conversations this week, both in Star Wars code:

• A gatekeeper of Silicon Valley's founder elite: "Drop the idealism. Speak like the Empire."
• A leading responsible tech coalition: "Values talk won't move capital."

Translation: the Rebel lexicon—justice, equity, transformation—is giving way to Imperial metrics: ROI, risk, profit.

Maybe that's just pragmatism.

Maybe that's how you smuggle change past the guards.

Or maybe, when we only speak power's language, we forget we once dreamed of redistributing it. No easy answers here. What do you think?

**Poll: What's the most effective way to create change from inside the Empire?**
- Lead with ROI (Empire): 9%
- Lead with values (Rebels): 31%
- Constant code-switching: 19%
- Need a new tongue altogether: 41%

When Google eliminated my role last Fall, I drove straight to the Redwoods in Oakland. Let those thousand-year-old giants remind me that some things endure beyond quarterly earnings.

Last weekend, Sally and I brought 50 folks from urban families to camp under those same ancient trees in Humboldt. Watching kids who'd rarely ventured into the woods discover that this magnificence belongs to them too? That's the real work.

Honored to see our social enterprise, Outdoorithm, featured in Greenwood Ave. magazine alongside other Black outdoor leaders. We're not just teaching people to camp, we're reclaiming birthright.

This weekend: backpacking Lake Tahoe's Emerald Bay with our daughters. Because the trails we blaze today become the paths they walk tomorrow.

"Where's that $100 million?"

The owner of Sweet Fingers Jamaican restaurant asked the question last week at Mayor Barbara Lee's economic forum. We were in a breakout room, fifteen people tasked with figuring out how to help Oakland's small businesses thrive.

Her restaurant sits on Foothill Boulevard in Deep East Oakland, right where Blue Meridian Partners spearheaded a $100M investment through Rise East. She can barely pay her PG&E utility bill.

The question hung there, unanswered. My stomach dropped. I know entrepreneurial vertigo, watching accounts hover near zero, borrowing against my home, skipping back-to-school shopping. But my vulnerability has safety nets hers doesn't.

Then Carolyn Johnson from Black Cultural Zone leaned in. She's a founding partner of Rise East. No defense or deflection. Just truth: commercial leases are designed to make restaurants fail. The system extracts from the very people serving their communities.

"What if we built an app to screen predatory lease terms?" The thought escaped before I could second-guess it.

The room came alive. The mayor's office grabbed the owner's info. CJ and I started dreaming about an app that could save small businesses before they sign their life savings away and exchanged info to keep the conversation going. Others offered coaching.

Fifteen minutes. From isolation to three concrete next steps. Not a solution, but at least the preconditions for one.

Trevor Parham, the founder of Oakstop who hosted the forum, and I call these "collisions," when people who need each other finally meet. Not charity. Recognition.

I'm excited to have teamed up with Oakstop as a fractional Chief Impact Officer. We're building infrastructure for these collisions at scale. Creating systems where capital, knowledge, and connections actually reach the entrepreneurs serving our communities.

We believe Oakland's future depends on these collisions, turning proximity into power. Hit us up if you agree and want to build with us.

I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new position as Co-Founder & CEO at Kindora with my co-founder Karibu Nyaggah!

$700M deployed at Google.org taught me how funders think.

Yet there I was, 11 PM in our Oakland living room, staring at 2,400 funder "matches" that would take a year to sort through.

My wife Sally was on the couch planning our nonprofit's winter camping trip. Outdoorithm Collective's bank account: $33,000. The heaters we needed: $9,480. Meanwhile, I was paying $3,600 annually for a "smart" fundraising platform that was drowning me in irrelevant matches.

I hit up the smartest people I know in philanthropy. Andrew at Gates Foundation: "Nothing like that exists." Nick at McGovern Foundation: Same answer.

So I opened Cursor and coded something that actually thinks like a program officer, not a search engine.

First test: 90% of matches vanished. False positives, eliminated.

Rising to the top? The George Family Foundation. Bill George was Karibu and my Harvard Business School professor, but I'd never connected his foundation to our family well being and outdoor equity work. The AI found a strategic match I likely never would have seen.

Within 24 hours: Meeting scheduled with their President, Kindora funder brief in hand to ensure we hit the right notes.

That same week, my friend called from Karibu's kitchen. What started as a catch-up became an hour-long conversation about what I was building. Karibu and I bonded 20 years ago over finding purpose in business. Now he's a leader in Silicon Valley.

We decided to build this properly. Together.

Kindora is now live and accepting beta users as a Public Benefit Corporation thanks to the brilliant team of Fredo Silva and Susan Mac Cormac at MoFo.

Because 1.5 million nonprofits shouldn't have to choose between finding funders and feeding families.

We built it for every worthy cause struggling to find their champion.

Now they don't have to.

Who else is drowning in false positives?

#nonprofit #philanthropy #AI #publicbenefit #startup

Special thanks to our stealth mode champions: Sally (Outdoorithm Collective), Tiffany Cheng Nyaggah (Catalyst:Ed), M. Très Watson (Taylor Made Futbol Initiative), and CJ Goulding (Boyz N The Wood) who trusted us early and helped shape what we're building.

Sally captured something I've been wrestling with since leaving Google: We've built an entire economy around sorting people, not connecting them.

$11,300 dropped at Disneyland—skipping past families waiting 240 minutes in lines we breezed through in 15. $100 at Humboldt Redwoods—where everyone stood on level ground.

At Disneyland, we knew exactly who could afford Lightning Passes.

At Humboldt, the wilderness didn't check our LinkedIn profiles. For $25/night, every family got the same ancient redwoods, the same river, the same stars. Outdoorithm Collective equipped everyone with the same setup, no gear advantage.

Both trips were magical. But only one showed us what America could be.

This is why Sally and I are betting on Outdoorithm Collective. Not because camping is the answer, but because public lands are where we can relate as equals and form a new shared identity.

Magic multiplies when shared, not hoarded. We need more folks to join us in proving it.

In fact, we're heading out today with 50 people to Sunset State Beach for Labor Day weekend. Different families, different backgrounds, same campfire!

"The work finds a way."

April morning. 7:30am. Kitchen counter covered in sandwich crusts I'm cutting off for my three-year-old. My phone buzzes. Hector Mujica from Google.org: "I saw somewhere you're working with an org on foster care?"

Foster care? In nearly a decade of leading Google.org's Americas team (mentoring Hector, building the $100M Google Career Certificates Fund together) foster care had barely crossed our grant dockets.

But here he was, six months after my role at Google was eliminated, asking about my new fractional Chief Impact Officer practice. Flourish Fund was one of my first clients at True Steele LLC. I was helping them build their philanthropy infrastructure.

A week later, I'm connecting Hector with Dan Vogel and Erin Bradbury from Flourish Fund. Despite everything, we all leaned in, building trust, finding alignment, discovering shared purpose.

The chemistry was instant. By month's end, I'm texting Hector that it felt meant to be. He agreed.

Google committed $2 million. No months of diligence, just strong track records across the board, unique alignment and trust built over years.

Yesterday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai announced that grant. The 370,000 children in foster care now have stronger champions through an innovative blend of AI tools and faith community mobilization.

This moment reminded me: The seeds you plant—the trust you build, the people you champion—live on long after org charts change. The work really does find a way.

Proud to see Dan and the Flourish Fund team's vision become reality.

"From the trunk to the world."

Six of us huddled around a table in the Kapor Center basement last night, our map of Oakland covered in sticky notes: Oakland Rooted. Keep Oakland Anti. Taste Makers. Every table was workshopping slogans, but at ours—me, Olatunde, Leandrew, Christiaan and others—those six words landed. Chairs leaned back, fists covered mouths, that unmistakable "yo, that's it" moment.

It evoked artists selling CDs from car trunks in East Oakland. DIY distribution as culture and business model.

Oakland invents, but too often, others capture.

Bosko and Miles from HiiiWAV pulled the forty of us deeper. Someone named our "innate intelligence"—the kind you hear when a neighbor on the nod can still recite a Ten-Point Plan. Then came the question that stilled the room: What's the economic engine that lets people stay?

"Town Bizness" kept surfacing. Brandon delivered a dissertation on it.

We made the Warriors; they crossed the bridge. Raiders and A's bounced too. Oakland's done exporting value without ownership, but we're too generous to center extractive capitalism.

So we started naming engines we can own: film and post-production training without degrees. New sound stages (michael mcbride). AI studios rooted in community taste. Pathways for legacy Black and Indigenous Oaklanders to return.

From the trunk to the world—this time, with more value kept here.

That's the assignment. I'm in, building with AI every day—two ventures deep—and here's what hit me after last night: Oakland needs its own studio sessions. Founders in a room for hours, building off each other's energy, failing, trying again. Like artists chasing the perfect track, except we're building ventures.

No prerequisites. No pitch decks. Just creation.

👉 Would you pull up if we hosted monthly "AI studio sessions" in Oakland?

Lili and I are exploring what this could look like. Your input can shape what we build.

Everyone feels unsafe. That's the point.

Jewish students say they don't feel safe on campus. Black students think: Welcome to America, we never felt safe. Conservative employees say they're silenced. Progressive employees say they're gaslit.

The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed—to make everyone feel precarious except the truly powerful.

I want my gladiator stronger too. We all do. We cloak it in moral language, but mostly we're just terrified of losing what little we have.

The arena grinds on, and all we've done is tilt the scales so a few more members of our tribe win the golden tickets.

I had one of those tickets for a decade. Made millions at Google. Gave it up—partly forced, partly choice. Now I'm back to doing impact work for a fraction of that.

The person you've been trained to see as your enemy is drowning in the same rigged game.

Only sacrifice creates the moral authority that actually breaks systems. You can't build a society with people you won't sacrifice for.

I think people are exhausted from the fighting. Ready for something that demands more than watching from the sidelines.

How long will we keep fighting each other for scraps while the table stays exactly where it's always been?

**Full Content:**

Yesterday I said everyone feels unsafe. Today I need to explain why—because there's actual science behind this mess.

Researchers discovered something they call the headwinds/tailwinds asymmetry. Here's what it means: We feel every bit of wind pushing against us. But the wind at our back? We forget it's even there.

I biked to work for 15 years through everything—snow, bomb cyclones, atmospheric rivers. I know headwinds. Fighting up Oakland hills into Diablo winds, counting every pedal stroke, cursing every gust. But when that same wind pushed me home? I'd forget it existed after the first block.

Our brains work the same way with advantages and obstacles.

Our four daughters, ages 4 to 16, each swear we're harder on them than their sisters. I always think the referees are against my teams.

Everyone's right about having obstacles. Everyone's blind to their advantages.

To be clear, some people face WAY bigger obstacles. The data is undeniable. A kid in East Oakland and a kid in Piedmont aren't playing the same game. Not even close.

But here's what makes it worse. Even the Piedmont kid can feel like a victim. Can't see the Oakland kid's obstacles. Finds it convenient to believe outcomes are about effort alone.

Meanwhile, the Oakland kid can't see that some Piedmont kids are drowning too—different water, still drowning.

The headwinds/tailwinds bias doesn't make obstacles equal. It makes everyone blind to what others carry.

Now here's where it gets dangerous: When everyone thinks they're the victim, everyone wants their gladiator in the ring swinging harder.

Everyone's drowning. Everyone thinks everyone else is swimming.

Add actual scarcity—only so many good jobs, good schools, good neighborhoods—and victim mentality becomes a blood sport. If you think you're losing unfairly, any tactic feels justified.

The only way out? We have to see our own wind.

We also can't build anything with people we won't sacrifice for. And you can't sacrifice if you think you're the one who's owed.

How long do we keep fighting each other for scraps while the table stays exactly where it's always been?

"The only good reason to raise VC is you have no other choice."

Roy E. Bahat (Bloomberg Beta) dropped the mic at Responsible Innovation Labs' EDGES gathering after I asked him today whether he'd raise VC funding if he decided to jump back into founder mode.

This morning I traded my typical day building Kindora and helping client startups grow for 7 hours at the KQED building in San Francisco asking the question Silicon Valley usually saves for post-mortems:

How do you build responsibly in the AI age before it's too late?

Brad Porter (deployed 500,000 robots at Amazon) served up a framework I'm stealing:

Scrappy-Crappy-Rigorous.

"Crappy is never acceptable. But you can only afford rigorous in a few places. Choose what differentiates you. We invested in trustworthy design from day one."

For me, responsible innovation isn't a place to be scrappy or crappy, it demands rigor.

Then Roy hit the nerve:

"Values are "right" versus "right" choices. When fast and ethical conflict, they're both good things. Which do you pick?"

This is it. The knife's edge every founder walks. You want responsibility AND survival. Values AND velocity.

At Kindora, we're building AI that helps nonprofits find the right funders and win, not drowning them in thousands of false positives like the platforms that drove me to build this. We chose Public Benefit Corporation status before launching the product.

Why? Because when the "right versus right" moments come—maximizing revenue or keeping AI accessible to grassroots nonprofits—our structure reinforces our values.

Three takeaways for AI builders:

1) Pick your "rigorous" wisely. Choose 2-3 places where trust matters most. Be uncompromising there.
2) Your investors shape your physics. Choose long-game partners. Or bootstrap.
3) Structure shapes behavior. You can't retrofit responsibility. Build it right now, or pay 100x later.

Here's what I'm telling myself about responsible innovation as I leave today:

It's not a constraint. It's your moat.

What do y'all think? Wishful thinking here or practical wisdom?

Reflections from attending the Clinton Global Initiative's 20th conference after leaving corporate philanthropy. Contrasted two events: the Clinton gathering, which emphasized collaboration and civility but lacked discussion of power dynamics, and a subsequent Ford Foundation event where speakers like Muhammad Yunus and Oxfam's Amitabh Behar directly addressed wealth concentration.

"Empathy without sacrifice is just cheap grace," borrowing from theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. The philanthropy sector often drifts toward "hope that asks nothing costly" rather than confronting systemic power imbalances.

Key Statistics: Billionaires accumulated $34 trillion over a decade while 735 million people face hunger; the top 1% produces as much carbon emissions as two-thirds of humanity.

Calls to Action:
1. Explicitly name concentrated power as the antagonist
2. Model empathy requiring genuine sacrifice and commitment to structural change

Attended as badge-holder for Kindora rather than Google.org, marking transition from filtered corporate messaging to independent advocacy work.

Announcing acceptance of the Champion Award from Self-eSTEM at their Oakland Innovator Showcase on October 4th. My career trajectory—from that pivotal moment to directing $700M in philanthropy at Google to founding Kindora and Outdoorithm Collective—demonstrates how mentorship creates ripple effects.

Kindora reached 146 beta users—nonprofits leveraging AI to identify aligned funders faster. When asked if the platform could serve individual donors, I explained why that's challenging.

Key Problem: Foundations operate transparently with public 990s and websites, enabling pattern matching. Individual donors remain largely invisible, while $251 billion sits idle in Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs).

Initial Solution Proposed: "The Follow Button for Philanthropy"—allowing donors to follow trusted philanthropists similar to investment platforms, making informal networks visible and mobilizing capital.

Insights from Gates Foundation's AI for Giving Design Day:

After consulting with 30 leaders, three critical findings emerged:
1. "Trust scales through stories, not data alone" with video outperforming lengthy reports
2. Philanthropic and wealth advisors serve as distribution channels—essential for scaling
3. Algorithms require intentional design to avoid amplifying polished narratives while marginalizing grassroots voices

Refined Direction: The mechanism shifted; wealthy donors typically trust advisors rather than following peers. The core challenge remains: unlocking idle philanthropic capital through better infrastructure for trust distribution.

The post sparked meaningful discussion about philanthropy's complexity. The tension between operational structure and community authenticity—"the real genius...is in mastering that unique blend" of professional standards and cultural depth.

Meaningful social impact requires navigating "that uneasy, essential tension between comfort and courage," and happens in "the messy, human space" between boardrooms and communities—not in isolation.

"Leave anyway."

Not "leave when ready"—you're never ready. Not "leave when it's convenient"—it never is. Just: Leave anyway.

Sally and I are both startup founders—Kindora, Outdoorithm, and a half-dozen clients between us. Four kids. Three grant deadlines last week. Twenty-four meetings on the calendar. And an atmospheric river rolling in.

We'd planned a camping trip to the coast months ago. By Thursday evening, every signal said stay home.

We left anyway.

Friday night, pulled into Gualala Point just as darkness fell. Set up the tent by headlamp. A raccoon immediately stole Eliza's mac and cheese right out of our van—welcome to the wilderness.

Rain pounded through the night. But Saturday morning? Redwoods dripping. River rushing. A stillness I hadn't felt in months.

We hiked. We played. We sat around a fire pit that had no cell reception and no demands. The kids explored tide pools. Sally and I remembered why we do this.

The families we passed on that trail weren't all seasoned campers. Some were clearly first-timers—tentative, figuring it out. That's who we're building Outdoorithm Collective for. People who didn't grow up with the gear or the knowledge, but deserve the same access to these moments.

If we'd stayed home, I would've spent two more 16-hour days at my laptop. Probably felt productive. Definitely would've missed the heron lifting off from the river at dawn, my daughter's face when she found her first sea star, the quiet of sleeping while rain drums on canvas.

Some rhythms are older than deadlines.

Leave anyway.

OpenAI just built a $130B foundation overnight. One of the largest philanthropic fortunes in America.

I spent a decade directing corporate philanthropy, so I know what comes next.

Carnegie built libraries after crushing workers. The libraries still stand. So does the inequality.

OpenAI didn't extract oil or steel. They mined every book ever written, every photo ever shared, every line of code ever posted—and turned it into private property.

So here's the question we should be asking OpenAI:

Are you willing to forgo the activities that require redemptive philanthropy?

Not how generously will you give back. But what will you refuse to build because it can't be made right through charity later?

Until we ask that question, we're just negotiating the terms of extraction.

You can't describe a painting and expect someone else to paint your vision. You have to hold the brush yourself.

I learned that years ago working on a Kehinde Wiley exhibit at the de Young.

Last week I was back home in Seattle at the AWS & Deloitte Social Entrepreneur Accelerator (SEA). 50 organizations from 20+ countries. Kindora was one of the organizations selected. Our first major accelerator.

During the program, Anthropic asked me to share how I built Kindora with Claude Code.

3:45 PM, the dreaded post lunch hour speaking slot. I'm standing in front of 100 people. The mic feels heavy.

I have an engineering degree but this is the first time in my life I've actually built software. I learned to code apps with AI.

I showed them what's possible: the analytics dashboard built in a weekend, the AI funder search tool unlocking grants for nonprofits, the git graph showing 10,000 to 100,000 lines per month with 67% fewer errors after jumping on the Claude Code train.

Then I demoed our live pipeline: 199 beta users.

"Oh snap, can y'all help me crack 200 while I'm up here?"

Abagail McKiernan's hand goes up in the front row: "I just signed up, does it update in real time?"

Refresh. 203. The room laughs.

But the moment that stayed with me came the next day at lunch.

Andre Peart and I started talking. Formerly incarcerated. Got out. Became a case worker. Saw organizations drowning in outdated tools.

So he built Untapped Solutions. Now backed by a roster of funders the envy of any founder.

He shared his playbook. Every pitch competition he'd applied to. Then pulled out his phone mid-conversation and texted me a specific opportunity: the Richard King Mellon Foundation pitch competition.

"Go get it," he said.

That's what I'm taking away: when we show each other what's possible, it gives us the courage to try.

Some of us in that room are already building with AI. Many haven't picked up the brush yet.

What would you build if you stopped waiting for someone else to understand your problem?

You can't describe a painting and expect someone else to paint your vision.

Last week Sally and I launched the digital version of Outdoorithm Collective—a platform to help families build community in the outdoors. Twenty people jumped on to beta test.

Then Thursday afternoon, board call while driving to the Pittsburgh airport. Michelle Austin, our first board member outside the founders:

"I just want to connect with people who have similar interests. But I can't."

She'd posted a comment seven days earlier in a community channel. Nobody saw it. Got buried. She wanted to discover other members, see their interests, feel like she belonged. Our platform wasn't built for that yet.

Five months. $17,000 with our developer. Solid foundation. But Chelle was lonely.

That night I opened my laptop on the flight home and started coding in Claude Code.

Saturday, 3:30 AM—still coding. Sunday, 1 AM—final push.

96 hours later:

Members can now discover each other. Share outdoor moments. See who else loves backpacking or wants to try camping. Create a circle with families heading to the same parks.

By Monday, Chelle logged back in. Uploaded a photo. Completed her profile: "I hope to someday lead trips that provide others opportunities to fall in love with the many benefits and blessings of spending time in the great outdoors."

Within days she'd earned 8 badges and hit #1 on the leaderboard.

The platform finally felt less like a website and more like a neighborhood.

**The build:**

Claude Code and I generated 69,844 lines of production code in that weekend. Twenty-two features. Real systems—profiles, social feeds, connections, recommendations.

For context: WhatsApp launched with 30,000 lines.

Not because I'm some coding savant. Until AI came on the scene, I had never coded an app. But the bottleneck moved.

**Pick up your paintbrush:**

Claude Code isn't autocomplete. It's a thought partner. I describe what people need—"Chelle wants to discover others like LinkedIn but engage like Instagram"—and it builds the system. Then we refine together until it's right.

The constraint isn't coding. It's knowing what to build.

**Why this matters:**

Social platforms today follow the same playbook: lock you in, sell your attention, extract every dollar while the experience degrades.

We're building something different. Civic infrastructure where public lands become the backdrop for real community. Where algorithms help you connect, not just scroll. Where belonging isn't monetized.

America is isolated. Divided. Lonely. We need spaces that bring people together.

**Join us!**

We just opened signups at https://lnkd.in/eivRwZHe (free for families—we define that broadly: parents, siblings, cousins, chosen family). Tag someone who needs outdoor community.

Sign up for a trip (like post-Thanksgiving camping in Half Moon Bay next week!).

Pick up the brush. Try building something small. See what becomes possible when you stop waiting for someone else to understand your problem.

This is my first Giving Tuesday asking instead of giving. It's humbling.

This past year co-founding Outdoorithm Collective with Sally Steele has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. More rejections in one year than probably my entire decade at Google.org.

One accelerator—20+ hours of work, a full pitch deck, recommendations from people in their community—rejected us with a form email. Gut punch. We picked ourselves up and kept going.

But then there are the beautiful yeses. Tony Emerson-Zetina, Ed.L.D didn't just support us with a grant. He and his wife Aishatu R. Yusuf, Ed.D., MPA showed up the night before our Sunset Beach group trip with headlamps on, helping us set up the communal tent in the dark. That's what we're building: people who give money AND contribute to the community.

This weekend, 40 of us proved it.

One of our mantras at Outdoorithm Collective is "Take Up Space." At Sweetwood Group Camp in Half Moon Bay (a fishbowl ringed by cypress trees and a public walking path) people kept stopping to ask who we were. Families mostly from the East Bay and Stockton. Not a Boy Scout troop. Not one big family. Just people discovering the outdoors together, many for the first time. One boy on the trip had never seen the ocean despite growing up just an hour drive away.

We're just over a year old. $150 covers one child's entire trip: gear, food, everything.

I'm not a software engineer. I'm a chemical engineer who spent a decade giving away $700M at Google.org.

But one night at 11pm, drowning in 10,000 "funder matches" for our tiny nonprofit Outdoorithm Collective, I opened an AI coding tool and started writing Python.

Minutes later, the AI cut 10,000 down to 100. At the top of the list: the George Family Foundation. Bill George had been my professor at Harvard Business School. I never would've connected his family foundation to our outdoor equity work on my own.

That moment became the spark for Kindora.

Next Friday (December 12) I'm sharing the full story on Brian Lofrumento's Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur podcast. It's a top 1% business show with 1,300+ episodes, and Kindora is the first Public Benefit Corporation to come on!

We went deep on how AI lets "non-technical" founders build real products, why we chose PBC structure to balance profit and purpose, and what it actually looks like to go from idea to MVP to first funders.

Here's a sneak peek. If you've ever thought "I'm not technical enough to build this," this one's for you.

Clinton Global Initiative, September. Hector and I grabbed a table in the lobby to catch up. Mistake.

Every three minutes, someone else. Hugs, handshakes, "Hector! What's up man!" It was like walking through an airport with MC Hammer. (Yes, I have that MC Hammer story. Another time.)

That's Hector. Life of every room he enters. But he's also the guy who'll vibe-kill the party to have a hard conversation. Who'll sit in the discomfort. I love that about him.

We built the $100M Google Career Certificates Fund together, creating pathways for Americans without four-year degrees. We worked on AI initiatives before most people knew what that meant. And on a team retreat, when his e-bike battery died mid-climb up a mountain, we scavenged rope from a junk pile and I towed him back to the hotel.

Earlier this year he called. "I'm thinking about running for Senate."

I assumed state senate.

"U.S. Senate. Florida." Let's go!

First-time candidate. Biggest swing possible. Pastor's kid from South Florida, son of Venezuelan immigrants, taking on a state everyone's written off. Recent polling shows the race is tied once voters learn who he is.

I'm on the host committee for a gathering in San Francisco on December 15th. Congressman Joaquin Castro, Diana Campoamor, and others are co-hosting. If you want to join me and meet Hector, link in comments. Hope to see some of you there.

"We have been going to Woodsman group camp for 48 years in a row."

I stumbled across this campground review last night planning a Sierra Nevada camping trip for Outdoorithm Collective.

48 summers. Same lake. Same family. That's beautiful.

It's also a 48-year head start.

They know which sites are magic. That reservations open 6 months early. To set an alarm for 7am on booking day. Knowledge passed down like a family recipe.

If your family didn't camp, nobody handed you the recipe.

That's the gap we're closing at Outdoorithm:
→ Camp Sage AI trained on real campground data — ask it anything
→ The only tool that calculates when to actually wake up for your campground (because "6 months out at 7am" isn't how most sites really open)
→ Cancellation alerts (how our family books 90% of our trips)

We can't give you 48 years of tradition.

But you shouldn't start from zero.

Summer spots are booking now → outdoorithm.com

Google eliminated my role a year ago.

I'd given away $700M in philanthropy. I could've found another seat at the table.

Instead: Nonprofit with my wife. Broke. Drowning in 10,000 funder matches. 11pm. An AI coding tool. An engineering degree I hadn't touched in 20 years.

That's the short version.

Brian Lofrumento, got the long one.
