Crafting an Engaging Year-End Founder Update
Introduction
A year-end founder’s update is an opportunity to authentically reconnect with your network, share your journey, and set the stage for future support. Unlike a typical company report, this communication should feel personal, reflective, and genuine, especially if many recipients haven’t heard from you in a long time. The aim is to update and inspire, not to push a hard ask. In this report, we outline best practices – from the tone and structure to optimal length and channels – drawing on what makes founder updates resonate and foster warm engagement over time.
What Makes Year-End Updates Engaging
Authenticity and Storytelling: Founder updates that get the most engagement are those that tell a human story rather than just listing accomplishments. Professionals today “are CRAVING realness and authenticity”linkedin.com. Share key moments of your journey – including challenges – in a sincere way. However, balance vulnerability with hope and progress. As one LinkedIn expert cautions, “being overly vulnerable without showing how you’re working through the challenge can harm your brand… People connect with vulnerability, YES, but they also look for problem-solving and progress”linkedin.com. In practice, this means you might openly acknowledge hardships (like a job loss or tough pivot) while also highlighting what you learned or how you overcame them. This balanced candor earns trust and makes your story compelling.
Gratitude and Community Focus: Emphasize appreciation for those who have been part of your journey. Even if contacts haven’t been actively involved yet, thanking your broader community signals humility and warmth. For nonprofit leaders especially, using language like “thank you,” “without you,” and “because of you” centers the impact on supporterspro.gofundme.com. For example, Allison Kelly, CEO of a social enterprise fund, opened her anniversary letter by expressing she is “filled with gratitude and pride for what we have accomplished… an incredible journey with an inspiring community working together”ica.fund. This kind of inclusive, appreciative tone makes readers feel valued and part of something meaningful.
Highlights with Context: To engage a wide professional audience, share a few noteworthy highlights from your year – but frame them in a narrative. Rather than a dry list of milestones, briefly explain why each development mattered in your journey or mission. If you launched a nonprofit initiative (e.g. Outdoorithm Collective) or a public benefit venture (Kindora), describe the “why” and impact behind those efforts. The most engaging updates often tie achievements to purpose. For instance, Allison Kelly enumerated growth metrics (e.g. investments made, participants supported) and then underscored the broader significance – “demonstrated that there is a wealth of opportunity in communities that are often overlooked”ica.fund. This helps even diverse contacts appreciate the context and feel inspired by the mission.
Future Vision and Invitation: End-of-year letters that perform well tend to look ahead with optimism and invite the audience along. After reflecting on the past, paint a picture of the coming year or new chapter: What’s next for you and your ventures? Keep this forward-looking section realistic yet inspiring – for example, describe goals within reach and why you’re excited about them. Crucially, subtly invite readers to stay involved. A great tactic is to express confidence that, “with your continued support, [we] will continue to make a lasting impact”ica.fund. This phrasing from Kelly’s letter gently primes readers for future support by implying they are partners in the road ahead. It’s not a direct ask, but it plants the seed that their support matters for reaching those goals.
Tone: Personal, Inclusive, and Accessible
Write in a Letter Style: The update should read like a letter from you, not a corporate memo. Use a warm, conversational voice and possibly even a greeting by name if feasible. As a PR team advises, “Start with a warm, personal greeting. This is an email from YOU, not a company.”linkedin.com This sets the tone as personal and genuine. Feel free to use first person (“I”) and even a bit of self-deprecating humor or humbleness when appropriate. The founder’s personality should shine through.
Balanced Professionalism: While personal and candid, keep the tone professional enough for a broad audience. Avoid slang or overly informal language that might not resonate with certain professionals. Likewise, keep the content accessible – explain any niche terms and focus on universal themes (resilience, learning, gratitude, purpose) that anyone in your network can connect with. The goal is a tone that is “vulnerable and compelling, yet accessible for a wide professional audience” (as you noted). Think of it as writing to a wise mentor or respected colleague: warm and open, but polished.
Show Empathy and Shared Humanity: A diverse network may include former coworkers, potential donors, investors, mentors, etc. One way to engage all of them is to highlight values and emotions they can relate to. Express empathy (for example, acknowledging that many faced challenges this year, not just you) and focus on shared aspirations. If appropriate, invite two-way connection – e.g., “I’d also love to hear how you’ve been; it’s been far too long.” Making it feel like a dialogue rather than a broadcast can strengthen relationship-building. In her re-engagement post, one founder even literally said, “Let me start by reintroducing myself” before summarizing her journeylinkedin.com – a friendly approach that treats the reader as a peer catching up, not an anonymous recipient.
Positive and Hopeful Frame: Even if your story includes difficulties (job loss, reinvention), frame the overall message around hope and purpose. You want readers to come away feeling optimistic about your trajectory and their potential role in it. For instance, after describing challenges and pivots, highlight the exciting outcome (new projects launched, new personal mission found) and convey enthusiasm for the future. End on a gratifying note – perhaps wishing them well for the holidays/new year and reiterating gratitude. A sincere closing like “Thank you for being part of my journey” followed by a forward-looking statement can leave a lasting positive impressionica.fund.
Structure and Length of the Letter
Keeping a clear structure will ensure your update is easy to follow. Here’s a recommended outline with approximate lengths:
1. Greeting & Acknowledgement (2–3 sentences): Open with a greeting that recognizes the long time gap. For example: “Dear friends – It’s been a while since I’ve been in touch, and I have so much to share.” A LinkedIn post example began, “Hey… it’s been a while since we last connected, and I have so much to share… Let me start by reintroducing myself.”linkedin.com This kind of opener warmly resets the connection. Keep it brief and genuine.

2. Personal Update & Story (1–2 short paragraphs): Summarize your journey since the last update. This might include the major transition (like losing a job) and what followed (reinvention, launching Outdoorithm Collective and Kindora). Rather than a dry chronology, share it as a story with a narrative arc – e.g., “Earlier this year, I faced [X challenge]. It pushed me to rethink my path and ultimately led me to [Y new mission].” Include a couple of standout achievements or milestones, but focus on meaning over just metrics. For each key point, explain why it mattered to you or how it contributes to your mission. One guide suggests identifying a few top developments and writing ~75 words on eachlinkedin.com, so you might highlight 2–3 big things (e.g. launching the nonprofit, first community event, early success stories, etc.) in succinct, vivid terms. Bullet points can be used if you have several distinct updates – but ensure they flow in a story sense (like chapters of your year).

3. Reflections and Lessons (1 paragraph): After the factual updates, take a step back and reflect. What did you learn this year? This is where you can weave in a bit of vulnerability with perspective. For example, “This journey has taught me about the power of community and resilience. I learned that setbacks can hide new opportunities – a lesson I carry into 2024.” Sharing 1–2 thoughtful insights makes the letter more personal and thoughtful, rather than just a status report. It also provides value to the reader (lessons they might apply to their own life). In Katja’s re-engagement letter, she enumerated two key lessons from her winding career path (combining passion with expertise, and being resilient through setbacks)linkedin.com – a technique that resonated with her professional audience.

4. Looking Ahead (1 short paragraph): Briefly outline what’s next in the new year and why you’re excited. Keep this grounded (realistic goals) but inspiring. For instance: “In 2026, our goal is to expand Outdoorithm’s mentorship program to 3 new cities and launch Kindora’s first community initiative. I’m thrilled about these plans because [reason – e.g., they address a need or fulfill a vision].” This section signals momentum. It also subtly lays groundwork for future support: you can mention you’ll be reaching out with more news, or that you’re hopeful to partner with others who share the vision. Focus on what’s within your control and strategiclinkedin.com, so it feels credible. This forward outlook engages those who might become donors or investors later by showing there’s a thoughtful plan (without directly soliciting them now).

5. Expression of Gratitude & Relationship Rebuilding (closing paragraph): End with a heartfelt thank you and an inclusive call to keep in touch. For example: “Above all, I want to express my gratitude – to old and new friends alike – for being part of this journey. Your support (even if just moral support or kind words) helped me get here. Thank you for reading this update and for being in my corner.” It’s wise to explicitly state no immediate ask here, only appreciation, since you want to avoid any transactional feeling. You might say something like, “I’m not asking anything today – I simply want to share where life has taken me and thank you for your role in it.” In nonprofit circles, this approach is akin to a “Thank-a-Thon” – a campaign of outreach with “no ask, no sales pitch, just a heartfelt thank you”blog.greatergiving.com. Such pure gratitude messages can delight and re-engage supporters because they’re unexpected in a world full of solicitations.

After the thank-you, you can add a light invitation for continued connection: e.g., “I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to as well – please hit reply or reach out on LinkedIn. Wishing you and your family a happy holiday season!” This keeps the door open for two-way communication and future support opportunities, “strengthening relationships and opening the door for future support” as you intend.

Optimal Length: Aim to keep the entire letter concise – ideally around 500 words, especially if it’s an email. A PR template for year-end letters suggests that if your draft goes beyond 500 words, “slice and dice until that word count is below 500”linkedin.com. Brevity respects your busy readers’ time and forces you to focus on the most compelling points. Many effective CEO/founder updates are in the 400–600 word range (roughly a one-page email or a 3–4 minute read). That said, on LinkedIn, posts/articles can be a bit longer if engaging, but even there, keeping it under ~700 words is wise to maintain attention. In short, quality over quantity – a tightly written, heartfelt update will have more impact than a lengthy missive. Use simple formatting (short paragraphs, maybe some bullet points or subheadings for longer sections) to make it easily skimmable. And consider including 2–3 relevant photos if possible (e.g. a photo from a project, or a team snapshot) – visuals can “spice things up and increase engagement”linkedin.com, and they reinforce that this is a personal update (seeing your face or work in action builds connection). Just ensure images are modestly used and fit the authentic tone (nothing overly glossy or “produced”).
Best Format & Channel: Email vs. LinkedIn (or Both?)
Choosing the right channel is crucial for reaching your diverse network. Each option – personal email and LinkedIn newsletter – has its own strengths:
Personal Email – Pros and Cons: Email allows for a highly personal touch. You can address contacts by name and tailor the tone as if writing to a friend, which is impossible in a generic LinkedIn broadcastemailonacid.com. This personalization can make recipients feel the message was crafted for them, enhancing engagement. Email is also an asset you own – you control your list, segmentation, and delivery, whereas on LinkedIn you “cannot take contacts off the platform” and have limited targetingemailonacid.com. In terms of engagement quality, email often encourages more focused reading. In fact, one creator who ran identical newsletters found that “engagement on LinkedIn simply doesn’t match what I see with email”thesciencemarketer.com – likely because an email in the inbox has the reader’s full attention, whereas LinkedIn content competes with a scrolling feed. Email open rates for a well-maintained list can be quite solid (average ~21–36% in recent yearslinkedin.com, sometimes higher for personal notes). If your contacts remember you, a subject line like “[Your Name] – A personal year-end hello” might pique interest.
However, email has downsides: your list may be outdated (contacts change jobs/emails), messages can land in spam or be overlooked in crowded inboxesemailonacid.com. If people haven’t heard from you in ages, some may not recognize your email or might have to be reminded how you know each other. It’s wise to remind the recipient of your connection early in the email (“It’s been a long time since [context of relationship]…”). Another con is that email lacks the easy public engagement features of LinkedIn – recipients can reply to you (which is great for personal connection if they do), but they can’t all see each other’s comments or likes. You won’t get the “viral” effect or social proof (no visible reactions). Still, if your goal is nurturing relationships, a few heartfelt email replies may mean more than dozens of passive “likes” on a LinkedIn post.
LinkedIn Newsletter or Post – Pros and Cons: LinkedIn has become a popular avenue for thought-leadership updates. A major advantage for re-engagement is reach: when you publish a LinkedIn newsletter for the first time, the platform automatically invites all your connections/followers to subscribethesciencemarketer.com. This can give you an immediate audience without needing everyone’s email. Many LinkedIn users accept these invites readily – one author saw a 15% conversion of followers to newsletter subscribers overnightthesciencemarketer.com. So, if you have a sizeable LinkedIn network, your update could quickly reach hundreds or thousands. Additionally, LinkedIn sends notifications and emails to subscribers for each newsletter postthesciencemarketer.com, which amplifies visibility. In 2024–25, LinkedIn newsletters have seen a 47% increase in engagement year-over-year, indicating growing user appetite for this formatsocialmediatoday.com. Another benefit: LinkedIn is a public forum. Readers can react or comment, creating a sense of community and allowing dormant contacts to publicly congratulate you or reconnect. Such interaction is visible to others, potentially sparking even wider engagement. If someone in your network comments “Great to hear from you!” that could remind another old colleague to reach out as well. This public engagement is something email cannot replicateemailonacid.com.
On the downside, LinkedIn newsletters/posts are less personal by nature. You cannot customize each message (everyone sees the same content, no personal salutations)emailonacid.com, and the tone might inherently feel a bit more broadcast. Some contacts might perceive a LinkedIn newsletter as less intimate than an email addressed directly to them. Moreover, engagement on LinkedIn, while broad, may be shallower. People tend to skim on social media; as noted earlier, one creator observed his LinkedIn newsletter’s clicks and deep reads were far lower than his email’s, attributing it to the distracting environment (users have “varying attention spans” on the platform)thesciencemarketer.com. Also, ownership and deliverability can be issues: you don’t control LinkedIn’s algorithm or who definitely sees the post. LinkedIn now provides open-rate metrics (they introduced an email-open metric for newslettersautoposting.ai), and early data suggests open rates on LinkedIn newsletters in B2B are around 22–28%autoposting.ai – similar to email. But you might have subscribers who never actually catch the content if they miss the notification. Another consideration: if your network isn’t very active on LinkedIn, an email might actually reach them more reliably. Conversely, if you lack current emails but are connected on LinkedIn, that platform might be the only way to reach them.
Why Not Both? In many cases, a multi-channel approach works best. You can publish the update as a LinkedIn article/newsletter and send a personal email to your closest contacts or those not on LinkedIn. If you do this, take care to vary the content slightly or stagger timing to avoid redundancy for those who might see bothemailonacid.com. For example, you might send the email first to a targeted list (with a very personal tone), and a week later post a polished version on LinkedIn for the broader network. Or vice versa: publish on LinkedIn, then email those you especially want to reconnect with, referencing the post (“I shared an update on LinkedIn, but I wanted to reach out to you directly as well…”). Using both channels maximizes reach: email for intimacy and direct contact, LinkedIn for breadth and community interaction. In fact, marketing experts note that LinkedIn’s algorithm rewards content that keeps people on the platform, so posting your story there can boost visibility (LinkedIn articles can even show up in Google searches, further extending reach)emailonacid.com. Just be mindful that truly personal messages should stay in email – you might reserve some heartfelt lines or individualized notes for email, while the LinkedIn version is more generally phrased.
Perception Considerations: A LinkedIn Newsletter carries a certain public-facing polish – it may brand you as someone who is open and “building a regularly engaged audience”thesciencemarketer.com, which is good if you want to establish thought leadership. However, because it’s public, ensure the tone is something you’re comfortable sharing widely (including with current/potential employers, investors, etc.). A personal email is private and can be a bit more nuanced or specific. Also, think about your recipients: busy execs may prefer a quick email they can flag to read, whereas those who live on LinkedIn might respond better there. There’s some evidence that professionals overwhelmingly “prefer the email inbox” for important messagesemailonacid.com – even LinkedIn itself uses email to pull people to newsletters, which says a lot. In fact, 75% of global consumers still prefer email for updates over social media channelsemailonacid.com. Knowing this, you might lean on email for those crucial contacts you really want to engage, and use LinkedIn to net the rest.
Recommendation: Given your scenario (first outreach in a while, broad network, two new ventures to showcase), consider a hybrid strategy: a personal email and/or a LinkedIn post, depending on contact. For key individuals (former mentors, close colleagues, top prospective supporters), a tailored email is ideal. For the wider audience, a LinkedIn newsletter will catch many you can’t email. You can even repurpose the same core content. If choosing only one, ask where your network is more likely to pay attention. If they all get LinkedIn notifications, a newsletter there could be effective and has the advantage of easy subscription and shareability. If they’re the type to read emails from you, then do that. There is no harm in doing both, as long as you are authentic in each format and not overly duplicative. In fact, combining channels is an omnichannel best practice – one marketing blog suggests using LinkedIn as a content “syndication” channel to complement (not replace) emailemailonacid.com. For example, you might post a shorter “teaser” on LinkedIn that summarizes highlights and then offers to send the full story to those interested (or links to your newsletter sign-up). But since this is a one-time year-end update, a full LinkedIn article could suffice.
Finally, whichever channel you use, mind the timing. Early to mid-December can be ideal for year-end notes – “the first 1–2 weeks of December before people really start to check out” is recommendedlinkedin.com. If using LinkedIn, avoid Fridays or holiday dates for posting (mid-week mornings often get better engagement). If emailing, try for a morning mid-week or even a Sunday evening (when people sometimes catch up on personal emails). Avoid the absolute end of year when inboxes are flooded with charity pleas and corporate newsletters – by sending a bit earlier with a personal touch, you’ll stand out.
Priming for Future Support (Subtly and Sincerely)
A core goal of your update is to nurture relationships so that down the line, contacts might become donors to your nonprofit or investors/partners in your PBC. The key is to inform and excite them now, without explicitly asking for money. Here’s how to do that:
   * Share Impact, Not Needs: Instead of saying “please donate” or “we need funding,” highlight what your ventures have already accomplished or aim to accomplish, and the impact on the community or market. For example, “Outdoorithm Collective has already mentored 50 youth outdoors this year, helping them build confidence and skills,” or “Through Kindora, we developed a pilot program that connected 100 families to eco-friendly baby products.” When people see concrete impact, it builds interest and goodwill. It subtly signals that supporting these initiatives has real results. One suggested outreach template for nonprofits is: “No sales pitch, just a heartfelt thank-you. Your support kept a local family housed this week. Two-minute update: [short link]. Thank you.”linkedin.com. In your context, even though you’re not thanking them for past support specifically, you can borrow the principle: focus on a success story (even a small one) attributable to your work, and express gratitude around it (e.g., thanking those who encouraged you early on, or simply the “community” for making it possible). This makes readers feel the mission is progressing and that there’s a positive story they could be part of, rather than feeling like you’re approaching them only when you need something.

   * Include Your Vision and Why It Matters: Prime future engagement by articulating the mission and vision of Outdoorithm Collective and Kindora in a compelling way. For instance, “I believe every child deserves the confidence that comes from outdoor adventure – that’s why I started Outdoorithm Collective” or “Kindora’s mission is to prove that a business can be both profitable and a force for public good, focusing on [specific social issue].” When your passion shines and the vision is clear, potential supporters are more likely to self-identify as allies. They may reach out on their own to ask how to help. Make sure this part of your letter is uplifting and inclusive – frame it as “here’s the better future we’re building, and I’m excited to have friends like you alongside”. Allison Kelly’s letter elegantly did this by stating the broader goal (“building an economy that works for all”) and directly crediting readers’ support: “With your continued support, I am confident we will continue to make a lasting impact… Thank you for being part of our journey. Together, we are building [that future].”ica.fund. Note how this both thanks and projects forward with the reader.

   * Subtle Call-to-Action (CTA): Even though you won’t make a direct fundraising or investment ask, you can still include a light CTA that primes engagement. This could be as simple as, “If you’re interested in learning more about [Org] or getting involved down the road, let’s definitely reconnect – I’d love to chat.” It’s open-ended and puts the ball in their court. Another idea is to invite them to follow your journey: “I’ll be sharing more updates on LinkedIn (and would love you to subscribe to our newsletter if you haven’t).” Since you are not asking for a donation now, you could ask for something easier: e.g., feedback or advice. People often respond well to being asked for advice or input, as it flatters their expertise. Perhaps, “I value your insights – if you have any thoughts or suggestions for Kindora’s growth, I’m all ears.” This can re-engage dormant professional contacts by making them feel helpful rather than put-upon. And it lays groundwork: someone who gives advice now may feel more invested and likely to support financially later.

   * Avoid Transactional Language: Be careful not to accidentally sound transactional (like “I look forward to your support” could be misread as expectation of money). Instead, use language of friendship and shared cause. For example, instead of “I hope you will donate in the future,” say something like, “I hope we can find ways to collaborate or support each other’s endeavors in the future.” This way, support is a two-way street and can mean many things, not just money. Emphasize relationship and mutual benefit. One LinkedIn commentator put it well: “The best connections come when you actually care – about people, not transactions. Help first, expect nothing. The returns show up later.”linkedin.com. This philosophy can guide your tone – show you simply want to reconnect and offer value (like sharing your story, or offering your help in return), and trust that good things (donations, partnerships) may come organically.

   * Consistency and Follow-up: Priming also means you should be prepared to follow up gently after this initial letter. In your year-end update, you might mention, “I’ll keep you posted quarterly on our progress” or “Plan to do these personal updates now and then.” Then make sure you do it. Consistent, honest updates build a narrative over time that donors/investors can follow, so when the time comes to ask, they feel already on the journey. This first letter is about re-opening the door. Going forward, keep that door open by occasionally sharing news or even personal check-ins without asks. Essentially, you’re starting the cultivation now so that any future support request feels like a natural next step in an ongoing relationship, not a sudden out-of-the-blue solicitation.

Examples of Standout Year-End Communications
Learning from others can provide inspiration. Here are a few examples and their takeaways:
      * Nonprofit CEO Year-End Reflection: As mentioned, Allison Kelly’s “5 Years in Reflection” letterica.fundica.fund is an excellent model. It combined personal reflection (her feelings and motivations) with concrete impact stats and deep gratitude. It was written in a humble, inclusive tone and clearly aimed to thank and energize supporters. Key takeaway: Blend heartfelt reflection and hard results, and always circle back to thanking your community.

      * “Just Checking In” LinkedIn Post: Fundraisers often recommend reconnecting with lapsed contacts by explicitly saying you aren’t asking for anything. One LinkedIn post template for nonprofits suggests starting with a line like “Missed you lately – just reconnecting, no donation ask. Year-end update, not an ask – just appreciation today.”linkedin.com. Some professionals have shared example scripts such as: “Hi [Name] – [Your Name] with [Org] here. No sales pitch, just a heartfelt thank-you for your past support. [Brief impact update]. Thank you and happy holidays!”linkedin.com. This approach often surprises and delights recipients, because it defies the expectation that a year-end message will ask for money. It can rekindle goodwill very effectively. Key takeaway: Sometimes the most effective ask is no ask at all, just thanks and a story – it builds receptiveness for future appeals.

      * Founder Comeback Story on LinkedIn: The post by Katja Vogtlinkedin.com we discussed earlier is a good illustration of re-engaging an audience after silence. She openly reintroduced herself, then used a narrative list of her winding journey, including being let go from a job, which made the story relatable and compelling. She ended by inviting people to follow her and asking a question to prompt comments. It garnered positive feedback (“welcome back!” comments). Key takeaway: Don’t be afraid to re-introduce yourself and your “why”; people may have forgotten or new contacts may not know your backstory. By sharing how you found purpose through ups and downs, you humanize yourself and invite others to re-engage and root for you.

      * Major Philanthropist Annual Letters: High-profile examples like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letter or MacKenzie Scott’s blog posts have large followings because they mix personal voice, transparency about failures/successes, and clear vision. For instance, Gates often writes in first person about what surprised him that year, what he’s learned, and he directly thanks partners and highlights others’ contributions. While your audience is smaller, the principle is the same: an authentic, reflective narrative will draw readers in more than a polished PR piece. Key takeaway: Even at scale, the best communications feel like “letters” – direct address, reflective tone, and honest discussion of challenges (not just cheerleading).

      * Thank-You Email with Photo: One simple example from a charity: Feed My Starving Children sent a brief year-end thank-you email to donors with a photo of children holding a “thank you” sign, and minimal text focusing solely on gratitude and what the donor made possiblepro.gofundme.com. Surprisingly, such emails often see high open and click rates because they tug heartstrings and have no secondary agenda. In your case, if you have a powerful image (say, you at an Outdoorithm event or a candid of a person impacted), embedding it at the top and captioning it with a note of thanks could increase emotional engagement (people process images quickly and remember them). Key takeaway: Visuals and brevity can amplify a heartfelt message – sometimes a picture plus a few sincere paragraphs can be more compelling than a long essay.

Conclusion and Final Tips
Crafting a personal, reflective year-end founder update is a powerful way to re-engage your network. By sharing your journey with honesty and gratitude, you remind people why they connected with you in the first place. Structure your letter with a clear beginning (reconnecting and updating), middle (insights and highlights), and end (thank you and future vision) to maintain flow and clarity. Keep the tone warm, respectful, and positive, as if you’re writing to old friends and mentors all at once. In terms of format, choose the channel that best suits your contacts – or use a combination for maximum effect – recognizing the strengths of each (personalization and depth via email, versus reach and community via LinkedIn).
Remember, the goal is to nurture relationships, not to solicit. Success will be measured in renewed conversations, replies, and perhaps some folks expressing interest in your projects – not necessarily immediate donations. As you write, constantly put yourself in the reader’s shoes: will they enjoy reading this? Is the language engaging and clear? Does it avoid making them feel guilty or pressured? If yes, you’re on the right track.
One founder summed up the relationship-building approach perfectly: “I treated networking like selling. It’s not. The best connections come when you actually care — about people, not transactions. Help first, expect nothing. The returns show up later.”linkedin.com. Approach your year-end update in this spirit – as a genuine reconnection and offering of your story, with no strings attached – and you will plant seeds that can lead to wonderful support down the line.
Good luck with your update, and happy reconnecting!
