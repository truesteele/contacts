\[repost \- Justin’s podcast announcement post\] 

I was on the couch intensely planning our next group camping trip.\\

He was at the desk in the corner, building something I didn't fully understand yet.

11pm. Four daughters asleep. Two founders trying to figure out how to fund a mission we believed in: getting urban families into the outdoors for the first time.

That night became Kindora. Today it became a podcast episode.

Proud of you, [Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinrichardsteele/)\!

Late last night. Staring at my calendar. Six months until July 4th weekend.

I know exactly where I want to be: at that beautiful campground with the quiet river where Eliza loves to watch the tiny fish swim.

A lot of folks wait till spring to start thinking about camping, but the best summer sites and holiday weekends fill up the moment reservations open. Six months out.

Here's what used to send me into an anxiety spiral: Did I count the days right? Is the reservation window already open? Do I need to get up at 7am tomorrow? Or is it the day after? Did I already miss it?

Turns out the actual camping is the easy part. It's the booking that breaks you.

Honestly? That's why we built our Outdoorithm tools. We want to spend summer weekends watching our kids run free and eating s'mores under the stars, not stressing over reservation algorithms.

If you're planning (or thinking about) summer camping, here's your roadmap:

1\. Find Your Spot (without the 47-tab research spiral) \- Camp Sage AI is like having a friend who's been to 11,000+ campgrounds. Ask it anything: "Find me a spot near water where my kids can fish, 2-3 hours from Oakland." It won't hallucinate because it's tied to our verified database of public campgrounds.

2\. Know Exactly When to Book \- Our Early Bird Reservation Calculator tells you the precise date and time your campground opens for summer reservations. No more guessing. No more missing windows.

3\. Get Notified When Spots Open Up \- Just launched: Cancellation Notifications. Missed your booking window or don't want to race against hundreds of other campers at 7am? Set it once, and we'll alert you when someone cancels. It happens more often than you think.

Prime summer spots for popular weekends (July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day) are booking NOW for many California campgrounds.

We built the tools we wish had existed \- so you can spend your energy dreaming about the campfire, not refreshing [Recreation.gov](http://recreation.gov/).

“From set up to meal time, I felt more and more comfortable as folks connected, provided support, and helped with everything I didn’t know. And honestly, my favorite part was the late-night campfire chats.”  
— Collective camper

I love reading camper notes at the end of our trips because the folks who experience it capture it best.

This is the heart of what we’re building at [Outdoorithm Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/company/outdoorithm-collective/): in a world where people feel increasingly disconnected from one another, our trips offer the opposite \- shared meals, shared work, shared joy. Community that forms quickly and stays with you.

I recorded a short video sharing what we’ve built, why it matters, and how you can help create belonging for more families.

\[Repost Justin’s coding post \+ launch announcement of membership platform\]

I'm excited to announce that Outdoorithm Collective's digital platform is live\!

We started with a universe of ideas \- and a lot of listening. We asked our community what makes connection feel real, what fosters belonging, what would make them more likely to get outside. We hired [Ben Polansky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpolansky/) to help us plot out the garden: membership model, values, user flow. We worked with [Matt Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattwatsonkc/) and Full Scale to build the infrastructure: database, user authentication, all the technical building blocks.

Months of decisions prepared the soil for the magic: [Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinrichardsteele/) planted 22 new features in 96 hours, and they bloomed into real connection.

Justin's post below tells the story of those 96 hours \- and what sparked them.

Here's what it all makes possible:

At every camping trip, I've watched strangers become chosen family around campfires. Kids calling each other's parents "Auntie." A Black father saying "I finally feel safe in the woods."

Now we have a digital campfire that doesn't go out \- a place to stay connected between trips and discover others who share your love for the outdoors.

Join us at [https://lnkd.in/gykNH5U9](https://lnkd.in/gykNH5U9) \- free for families (we define that broadly).

Shout-out to our board for making this possible: [Michelle Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-austin-15380b178/) [Kay Fernandez Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-fernandez-smith-24a3777/) [Carl L Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carllmiller/)

**Take up space.**

That's the newest mantra at Outdoorithm Collective. Not "be respectful" \- that's always true. Not "know your place" \- these places are yours too. Just: Take up space.

7am Sunday morning, Sugarloaf Ridge State Park. Justin Steele and I jolted awake to voices echoing across the campground:

"IT'S GONNA BLOW\!\!"

"Dad\! Dad, I got one on\!"

A family two sites down \- boys fishing in the creek, yelling back to their campsite at dawn. My first thought? Honestly, I was kind of annoyed. My second: remembering how amazing it is to share firsts with your kids.

Later, their generator ran for thirty minutes. I noticed their trailer \- duct tape holding panels together, missing side mirror, clearly making outdoor spaces work with what they had. Was the loudest generator in the world annoying? Yes. But they were taking up space with what they had.

Here's what I realized watching them: They take up space naturally. Loudly. Without checking if they're allowed.

And here's what I realized on the trail up Bald Mountain: we could, too. And we did \- for the first time in three visits to this park.

Three guys coming down the fire road, one hauling a massive orange Gatorade cooler. Old Justin: polite nod, eyes down, keep moving. Sunday Justin: "Hey bro, making sure you don't run out of water?"

They burst out laughing. "We ran out anyway\!"

I grinned at him, noticing the change.

At the summit \- 360 degrees of the Bay Area sprawling below \- I set my backpack down on a massive redwood bench and fell asleep. Never have I ever. But those three hours of sleep and the long hike caught up with me. Twenty minutes, out cold, while monarch butterflies circled. Sunday Sally felt safe enough to completely let go.

Small moments. Huge shift.

That's what taking up space looks like.

Families with generational camping rhythms don't wonder if they're being too loud, too present, too much. They fish at dawn because that's what their parents did. They run generators because they've always belonged here. They nap at summits without second-guessing.

Many BIPOC families, ours included, tend to shrink. We monitor our volume. We give deferential nods. We don't want to be tagged (or targeted) as not belonging \- even though these lands are equally ours.

This is why Outdoorithm Collective exists. To give families permission to be fully present in outdoor spaces. To engage strangers on trails. To sleep at summits because you're tired and this mountain is yours, too.

Taking up space doesn't mean being inconsiderate. It means existing fully. Not shrinking yourself to make others comfortable in spaces that belong to everyone.

This weekend, notice when you shrink yourself outdoors. Then don't. Say the thing to the stranger on the trail. Stay longer at the viewpoint. Laugh louder around the campfire.

Take up space. These lands are yours too.

Higher up, an older cyclist huffing behind us crested the hill as we hit flat ground. I turned: "I bet you're glad to have this flat section."

He startled. "What?" Then chuckled and smiled: "Oh yeah, happy to be done with that climb."

Weekends as a founder often look like this: Full inbox. Grant edits. Strategic planning doc.

If you let it.

Last week I shared one of our [Outdoorithm Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/company/outdoorithm-collective/) mantras: "Leave Anyway." It's about choosing the pause even when (especially when) you feel like you can't afford it. That post was about leaving for a camping trip despite the chaos. This Sunday was simpler \- 40 minutes on the trail \- but the practice is the same: choosing essential over urgent, choosing to take a breath and hit that reset button.

Not every weekend needs to be epic. It just needs to happen.

October 27 (ish) 2025

Leave anyway.

That's become a mantra at Outdoorithm Collective. Not “leave when ready”—you're never ready. Not “leave when it's convenient”—it never is. Just: Leave anyway.

Friday morning early, 1am. Justin and I collapsed into bed. We had 18 hours before we were supposed to check in for a campsite on the coast we'd booked blind six months ago.

His week: 24 meetings. Mine: 3 grant deadlines. Our reality: 2 startups to run.

The forecast: Atmospheric river hitting the west coast.

The smart move: Cancel everything. The deeper pull: Leave anyway.

Friday 5pm, Justin still closing client work. Me closing up grant applications racing to grab Eliza from school. We threw gear in our van like we were fleeing disaster—which we were. The disaster of letting urgent crowd out essential.

10pm arrival at Gualala Point. Pitch black. Justin checked our trailer. A raccoon immediately jumped IN our van, stole Eliza's mac and cheese, and bolted. Justin chased it into the woods, wrestled the container back.

Then the rain. All night. Hard.

But morning: rain dripping off redwoods, the Gualala River flowing past our site, a stillness I hadn't felt in months. This is what happens when you leave anyway.

At the beach, massive waves pounded while Eliza scrambled atop a driftwood castle others had built. "Seven more nights camping\!" she demanded. "Not one\!"

The trail filled despite the downpour—kids in head-to-toe rain gear, families who'd all left anyway.

Four families on that trail. One looked like ours. That's not a nature problem. That's an access problem.

This is why Outdoorithm Collective exists. Not everyone inherits camping knowledge. Not everyone has gear passed down through generations. But every family deserves to hear rain on redwoods, to feel their nervous system finally exhale.

Here's what staying home would have given us: Two more 16-hour days. More checked boxes. The illusion of progress.

Here's what leaving anyway gave us: Eliza hunting for "Terradactyl skulls” in driftwood. That 3am moment when rain on the van reminded us that some rhythms are older than deadlines.

The sacred pause doesn't come to you. You have to break the gravitational pull of your beautiful, overwhelming life.

*Leave anyway.* The hardest part isn't camping—it's leaving.

Nature doesn't check your calendar. It just waits.

This weekend, cancel something. Pack badly. Leave anyway.

Forty-five outdoor founders of color. Three days. A rooftop terrace on the final morning where everything came together.

I've spent the last few days at REI's Path Ahead Ventures Summit \- a gathering of alums from their accelerator programs \- and I'm still processing the power of our time together. After three days connecting through the peaks and valleys of the founder journey, we closed with the theme "Reimagine." I started the morning co-leading a session with [Keva Niver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keva-niver-37bbb994/), holding space for founders to share the purpose that keeps them grounded \- the 'why' that sustains us through all the pivots and revenue pressures.

The stories were honest. Personal. Grounded in purpose in ways that reminded me why we do this hard work.

The morning ended with a guided meditation by [Zulma Y.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zulmayt/) Terrones and [Felipe Vieyra Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipevieyra/) who offered us reflective music and questions that cut through the noise: Who am I when I lead from my strengths? In what ways have my experiences forged the leader I am today and the one I'm still becoming?

I wrote: Open. Curious. Grounded and Grounding. Joyful.

And then: Cautious. That one caught me off guard.

But surrounded by founders who believed in each other \- genuinely, deeply \- a different word emerged: BOLD.

Community reflects back what's already in you. It helps you trust your intuition when the endless decisions blur together.

I left inspired, connected, and rested. To all the founders \- folks I've been traveling with for a while and those I've just met \- I'm excited for us to be bold together.

Thank you to [Dan Kihanya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkihanya/), [Susan Viscon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-viscon/), and [Keenan Corrigan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenan-corrigan/) at REI PAV for believing in and advocating for us, to the PAV planning team [Jessika Agyepong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessagyepong/) and Katie Walther, and to fellow founder [Yvonne Leow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvonnetleow/) for the intentional design of the summit. You all made this weekend and this community happen.

Early October 2025

I felt the gap before I could name it. Three days. Two rooms. Same crisis, different lenses.

In Philly at the [Justice Outside](https://www.linkedin.com/company/justice-outside/) conference last week, I stood by the elevators comparing notes with Daniel Hunter \- organizer, movement trainer, author of Climate Resistance Handbook. In his keynote, he'd shared research showing it takes only 3.5% of a population acting collectively to create major political change.

The room felt like that 3.5% at work. Round tables. Practitioners from outdoor programs, advocacy groups, and think tanks imagining and building toward a new future—where urban kids claim redwoods as theirs, where families learn they belong in nature, where democracy gets rehearsed around campfires.

Three days later in New York City at Climate Week, the opening fireside chat at New Climate Futures focused on Team, TAM, and Tech. Compete with China. Win. Revenue. Someone noted that the word "climate" was barely being used \-at Climate Week. The word "community" never came up at all.

I felt a little grief for what gets lost when we optimize for everything except people. And yet these are people building innovations we need: clean water systems, renewable energy, technologies that keep our planet from sliding further.

The two rooms weren't talking to each other.

Both are necessary. One builds community power. One builds literal power grids. But siloed, something essential gets lost.

Maybe the work isn't picking a room. Maybe it's recognizing they both matter.  
When the goal is generating revenue and coming out on top, community work gets called a 'nice to have.' But it's so much more than a 'nice to have' \- it's the meaning-making that helps people discover what's worth protecting.

People don't protect what they don't love. And love grows from belonging.

Excited to continue building community and belonging through [Outdoorithm Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/company/outdoorithm-collective/). Grateful for some of the co-workers in the space who I got to spend last week with [CJ Goulding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjgoulding/) [Sage Innerarity](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sage-innerarity/) [Lia Cheek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lia-cheek-81310a3b/) [Juan D.

September 16, 2025 \[response to Justin’s post\]

[Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373754388894625792/#)'s post hits at the heart of something I've seen both as a minister and through our work building community in the outdoors: we desperately need sacred spaces.

Sacred spaces aren't just set-aside places. They are containers we build intentionally for belonging, and they cost us something \- the safety of familiar circles. Sacred spaces are where we can practice the relationships that actually challenge who holds power while navigating both our deepest disagreements and our shared humanity. Our differences matter deeply \- and our votes have real consequences. This requires the harder work of inner change and loving our neighbors well, not the false neutrality churches sometimes call us to.

The arena keeps us competing for scraps. Sacred space is where we practice the relationships that could flip the table.

Early September 2025

Here are some big questions keeping me up at night:

\- How do we design digital spaces that foster genuine belonging instead of performative connection?  
\- What does it mean to invite people into community when membership itself can be an act of exclusion?  
\- When does environmental stewardship become activism \- and who gets to decide?  
\- Can shared vulnerability in nature create the conditions for bridging difference, or are we just camping with people who already look like us?

Bringing these questions with me to the East Coast in a couple of weeks for the [Justice Outside](https://www.linkedin.com/company/justice-outside/) conference in Philly and Climate Week in NYC.

**High Standards, Open Doors**

$11,300 at Disney. $100 at Humboldt Redwoods. One sorted us by income. The other showed us what America could be.

Yesterday's NYT piece ("Disney and the Decline of America's Middle Class") brought it all back. Our 2023 Disney trip was magical—character meals, light shows, riding Splash Mountain on its final day. First time there, loved it, but couldn't ignore how different our experience was from others. One sign indicated a 240 minute wait in line, we skipped to the front in 15 with our Lightning Passes. Every ride, no lines, breaks at our Grand Californian Hotel suite.

That was when Justin had his tech job. Google eliminated it last year. Now we are building Outdoorithm Collective, betting everything on bringing families together in nature.

Different story this July: Humboldt Redwoods with Outdoorithm Collective. 48 folks, 12 families. Our costs for campsite fees came out to about $25 per night for each family.

When a campervan got stuck on the river bank, the engineer, doctor, social worker, actor \- everyone grabbed shovels and pushed. When it lurched free, we flexed like we'd won the championship.

Around the campfire in the darkness, Justin and I suddenly realized our 4-year-old Eliza was gone. Before panic set in, another parent pointed: "She's at Uncle John's fire with his kids." She'd started calling him uncle after meeting him 48 hours earlier. Now he was family.

The doctor taught the children to walk a rope line. A high schooler became bike instructor for the little ones. An educator showed them how to make glow stick glasses. Deep in the redwood groves, a survivor found healing in conversation with a street preacher \- both giving each other life.

Our kids turned the cul-de-sac into a massive chalk mural, racing bikes through their art while we cooked communal dinners. Everyone flipped pancakes. Everyone washed dishes. Everyone's kids became everyone's responsibility.

At Disney, I knew exactly who could afford Lightning Passes. The algorithm sorted us perfectly.

At Humboldt, nobody sorted us at all. The wilderness doesn't check LinkedIn profiles. The river doesn't care about your ZIP code. For $25 a night, every family can experience the same ancient redwoods and the same swimming hole.

At Disney, setting high standards came with velvet ropes and price tags. At Humboldt, high standards meant everyone taking turns at the camp stove, everyone pushing that stuck van, everyone watching everyone's kids.

449 nights at Humboldt for the price of three at Disney.

We'll remember both trips. One for the magic money could buy. The other for the magic money couldn't touch.

The wilderness doesn't have Lightning Lanes. Let's keep it that way.

Join us in building bridges, not barriers, in America's public lands.

Generational Gifts. That's what I was thinking about yesterday as I stood in a public storage unit with two board members and one of our youth leaders to sort camping gear. Not how I would normally spend a Sunday, but there we were.

I picked up an unlabeled stuff sack, unzipped it, and found it full of straps. "Oh, these go with the hammock," I said, looking around to pair it up.

But it's so much more than a hammock. I was flooded with memories: kids from our [Outdoorithm Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/company/outdoorithm-collective/) community, across multiple trips, figuring out how to set up that hammock. Younger kids clamoring for turns. Squeals of laughter as they piled on together.

What started as inventory became something sacred.

I watched one of our youth leaders carefully organize gear for families she's never met but already considers community. She wasn't just sorting equipment \- she was tending to tools that remove barriers, that make room for families to connect and heal under the stars, most for the first time.

In that moment, I was reminded that generational gifts aren't just inherited, they're actively cared for by each generation.

Every tent has held families with their own unique stories. The hammock has cradled giggling children. The grill has cooked meals shared between strangers who became friends.

These aren't just things \- they're vessels for transformation. What we tend today becomes the gift we pass along tomorrow.

Shout out to our board members [Kay Fernandez Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-fernandez-smith-24a3777/) and [Michelle Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-austin-15380b178/) for spending their Sunday pouring into our community in this way (and [Justin Steele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinrichardsteele/) for fielding our electronics gear questions via text).

This gear has already supported 260+ participants across 9 Outdoorithm Collective trips \- over 21,000 hours of families discovering they belong in the outdoors. We're growing and our membership opens soon \- follow along for updates. Interested in co-creating community with us? Reach out\!

July 2025

Starting a business is one of the hardest things I've ever done, probably second only to birthing and parenting 4 kids and all that that involves. Both can be hard, messy and chaotic. There are books galore but no real manual because the reality is that you have to carve your own path \- all while knowing you're not doing it just for you. You're doing it with a bigger vision, a bigger hope, a bigger purpose in mind.

That’s why being featured in Greenwood Ave. feels so meaningful. This magazine not only honors the legacy of Black Wall Street but shines a light on today’s Black entrepreneurs and the communities they’re building. Seeing Outdoorithm included alongside so many powerful stories is a reminder that this work matters—and that none of us are building alone. Community is at the center of everything we do.

We’re exploring bold new ways to grow Outdoorithm—including the idea of cooperative ownership, where more people can help shape what comes next. If you’re passionate about reimagining who belongs in the outdoors and want to be part of building something different, let’s talk.

Thank you, Greenwood Ave., for shining a light on our journey and so many others blazing new trails.

"Camp as it comes."

That's the new mantra we introduced this past weekend at Outdoorithm Collective's Memorial Day trip to Pinnacles National Park—and, as it turns out, we really did need it.

After squeezing in our 16-year-old's birthday celebration Friday night, Justin and I rolled into camp with three kids at 11 PM—after camp quiet hours, pitch black, three group sites to navigate, and a 3-year-old who'd fallen asleep in the car but was now wide awake and letting everyone know. We unhitched our trailer at the wrong site, dragged it across the street in the dark, and pounded tent stakes by headlamp.

Exhausted, we collapsed into our sleeping bags at midnight. Then at 1:30 AM, a tiny toddler voice: "Daddy, I threw up."

What followed was a middle-of-the-night cleanup involving eight compromised stuffies, a ruined sleeping bag, raccoons interested in our throw up trash, and two more rounds of illness before sunrise. Not exactly the peaceful camping arrival we'd envisioned as we prepared to welcome 40 novice campers to the site, many of them for their first camping trip.

But here's the thing—we kept laughing at ourselves and returning to our mantra: camp as it comes.

The next three days were magic. Forty folks from urban families came together at one of California's most dramatic national parks. A dozen kids under 10 formed an unbreakable pack, sliding down dirt hills, climbing ancient volcanic boulders, and exploring hidden caves. Teenagers mentored littles. Families from different backgrounds shared meals, stories, and genuine connection under star-filled skies.

None of it was perfect. All of it was transformative.

"Camp as it comes" isn't about lowering expectations—it's about raising our capacity for wonder, adaptation, and authentic community. It's recognizing that the most profound experiences happen not in controlled conditions, but when we learn to thrive with whatever we're given.

As we transition back to busy city life, we're holding onto this lesson: Whether it's 3 AM tent cleanup or awe-inspiring sunrise over volcanic peaks, it's all camping. It's all part of our story.

Through Outdoorithm Collective, we're creating these kinds of transformative outdoor experiences for urban families—especially those historically excluded from outdoor spaces. Because everyone deserves to discover that they belong in nature, exactly as they are.

Sometimes the best adventures are the ones that don't go according to plan.
