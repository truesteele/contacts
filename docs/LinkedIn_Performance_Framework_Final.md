# **Quickstart: Score Any Post in 5 Minutes**

Use this workflow before publishing any LinkedIn post.

1. **Pick the job:** Reach / Engagement / Action

2. **Pick a voice:** Prophet / Builder / Teacher / Community Host

3. **Pick a topic pillar:** Social Commentary / Career-Impact / Philanthropy / AI Building / Outdoor (see pillar matrix)

4. **Pick an archetype** that matches your voice \+ goal

5. **Score Reach (0–10) \+ Engagement (0–10);** add Action Score if needed

6. **Apply adjusters** — adjusters change expectations, not the base score

7. **Check for avoid patterns** (Host \+ reshare, polls, product updates without story)

8. **Publish \+ run post-ops checklist**

## **Post Archetypes by Voice & Goal**

| Voice | Goal | Archetype | Expected Outcome |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Prophet | Reach | Text-only commentary on breaking news \+ big-name anchor | High impr., lower ER |
| Teacher | Reach | Document/article that teaches a framework or playbook | Moderate reach, shareable |
| Builder | Engagement | Photo \+ personal narrative \+ origin story \+ lesson | High ER, community |
| Builder | Both | Photo \+ origin story \+ big-name \+ community gratitude ("Unicorn") | Rare: high reach \+ ER |
| Host | Action | Photo/doc \+ one clear ask (follow/signup/donate) | Conversions |

## **Fill-in-the-Blank Templates**

### **Prophet Template (Timely Commentary)**

1. 1st line: \[Event/news\] \+ \[Big-name anchor\]

2. 2nd line: Your POV as a question or tension (not a verdict)

3. 3rd line: The stakes (why it matters now)

4. Close: Answerable question (not rhetorical)

### **Builder Template (Photo \+ Origin Story)**

1. Scene (specific time/place)

2. Struggle/stakes (real tension)

3. Turning point

4. Transferable lesson (the "gift")

5. Gratitude \+ question

### **Teacher Template (Framework)**

1. Promise a framework in the opening

2. Ground in a specific moment

3. Deliver structured takeaways

4. Close: "What would you add?"

### **Community Host Template (Action)**

1. Problem or opportunity

2. Proof

3. One clear ask

4. Link in comment (not body)

## **Post-Ops Checklist (First 60 Minutes)**

1. Respond to first 5–10 comments quickly

2. Ask follow-up questions in replies

3. Pin a comment with context/links/CTA

4. If action post: link in first comment, not body

# **Executive Summary**

This analysis examines your complete LinkedIn posting history. The core finding: **reach and engagement are fundamentally different games**—and your data proves this clearly.

Your highest-reach posts are text-only commentary on breaking news (Prophet voice). Your highest-engagement posts are photo-driven personal narratives (Builder voice). Trying to optimize for both simultaneously often results in mediocre performance on both.

## **The Reach vs. Engagement Tradeoff**

* **Text-only posts** averaged \~42,000 impressions but only \~1.08% median ER. They're your **reach engine**.

* **Photo posts** produced 48.6% of total engagements while accounting for 25.3% of impressions. They're your **engagement multiplier**.

Decide what job each post is doing before you write it—and judge success accordingly.

# **Your 2025 Performance Baselines**

These baselines come from your 42 original posts in 2025\.

**Data & Methodology**

| Baseline computed on 42 original 2025 posts (excluding March 3 combined bundle). Metrics source: LinkedIn Analytics export dated December 13, 2025\. Engagement rate \= (reactions \+ comments \+ shares) / impressions × 100\. |
| :---- |

| Metric | Your 2025 Baseline |
| ----- | ----- |
| Median Impressions | \~4,750 |
| Median Engagement Rate | \~2.66% |
| Top 25% Impressions Threshold | \>10,300 |
| Top 25% Engagement Rate | \>4.0% |
| Top 10% Impressions Threshold | \>23,700 |
| Top 10% Engagement Rate | \>4.7% |

# **What Drives Reach (Impressions)**

## **Format Analysis: Text-Only Dominates**

Your highest-reach posts share a consistent format: text-only commentary anchored to breaking news. Three of your top six posts by impressions had no media attached.

| Date | Topic | Impressions | Format |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Jan 11, 2025 | Meta DEI Rollback | 113,584 | Text only |
| Dec 4, 2024 | Reformer's Dilemma | 78,951 | Article |
| Jun 30, 2025 | Harvard/UVA Under Attack | 51,958 | Text only |
| Nov 20, 2024 | Leaving Google | 51,839 | Photos |
| Jan 6, 2025 | How to Break Into CSR | 43,724 | Article |
| Oct 30, 2025 | OpenAI Foundation Critique | 24,158 | Text only |

## **The Big-Name Anchor Effect**

In your dataset, posts with big-name anchors (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Harvard, etc.) averaged \~17,500 impressions vs \~5,300 without—a **3.3x effect on average**. The median ratio is 2.3x.

However, a big name alone isn't enough. The effect is strongest when combined with **Prophet voice \+ timeliness**. Prophet posts with big-name anchors averaged 49,700 impressions.

**Important:** Prophet voice can work without a big-name anchor if the moral tension is strong enough. "Everyone Feels Unsafe" achieved 12,808 impressions with NO big-name anchor—proving intrinsic moral tension can substitute for institutional anchors.

## **Timeliness as a Reach Lever**

Posts published within 24–48 hours of news tended to be highest-reach. **Implication:** Maintain a mental inventory of topics where you have unique authority.

## **Deep Dive: Meta DEI Rollback**

**113,584 Impressions (1.4× your second-best)**

**Opening:** "Meta announced today..." Establishes relevance to the day's biggest story.

**Pivot:** "But I keep mulling..." Signals you have something to say.

**Thesis:** "Are America's most powerful companies sleepwalking...?" Creates cognitive tension.

**What you didn't do:** No credentials, no CTA, no hashtags, no media. Zero friction.

# **What Drives Engagement**

## **Format Analysis: Photos and Personal Narratives**

Your highest-engagement posts are identity-reinforcing—launches, wins, values statements—and invite celebration.

| Date | Topic | Eng. Rate | Format |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Aug 18, 2025 | Kindora Launch | 5.76% | Photo |
| Sep 26, 2025 | Clinton Global Initiative | 5.30% | Photo |
| Nov 19, 2025 | Outdoorithm Platform | 4.96% | Photo |
| Nov 10, 2025 | AWS Accelerator | 4.85% | Photo |
| Sep 30, 2025 | Self-eSTEM Award | 4.70% | Photo |

## **The Power of Origin Stories**

Your highest-engagement posts tell the story of how things came to be. Kindora launch: "11pm, drowning in 10,000 funder matches..." Origin-story announcements consistently outperform plain announcements.

## **The Unicorn Post (High Reach \+ High ER)**

Only **one post** achieved BOTH top-25% reach AND top-25% ER: **Kindora Launch** (23,747 impressions / 5.76% ER).

**Unicorn recipe:** Builder voice \+ Photo \+ Origin story \+ Big-name anchor (Google.org mention) \+ Community gratitude (named Sally, Tiffany, Très, CJ).

This is the rarest and most valuable archetype. Don't expect it often, but when the elements align, pursue it.

# **Content Type & Topic Pillar Performance**

## **Content Type Matrix**

Based on 2025 data. Small samples should be treated as hypotheses.

| Content Type | n | Med. Impr. | Avg Impr. | Med. ER | Best For | Confidence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Text-only | 5 | 24,158 | 42,355 | 1.08% | Max reach | Low |
| Article/Doc | 5 | 9,811 | 15,273 | 1.54% | Frameworks | Low |
| Photo | 23 | 4,887 | 6,576 | 3.65% | Engagement | High |
| Reshare | 5 | 4,468 | 4,300 | 2.66% | Supporting | Low |
| Video | 3 | 1,495 | 1,709 | 3.68% | Underused | Low |
| Link/Poll | 2 | 3,914 | 3,914 | 1.27% | Avoid | Very Low |

## **Topic Pillar Matrix (NEW)**

Topic pillar has **the largest effect size** in your data. Social Commentary dramatically outperforms.

| Topic Pillar | n | Avg Impr. | Med. Impr. | Avg ER | Confidence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Social Commentary | 7 | 32,676 | 14,314 | 1.75% | Medium |
| Career / Impact | 6 | 12,184 | 6,904 | 3.19% | Medium |
| Philanthropy | 8 | 5,934 | 4,076 | 2.64% | Medium |
| AI Building | 10 | 5,368 | 2,769 | 3.69% | Medium |
| Outdoor | 8 | 5,453 | 3,964 | 2.73% | Medium |

**Key insight:** Social Commentary is your **reach engine** (32,676 avg vs 5,368 for AI Building—a 6x difference). When you want maximum reach, lead with social commentary topics where you have standing, not venture updates.

## **Reach vs. Engagement Quadrant**

* **High Reach / Low ER:** Text-only \+ Social Commentary \+ Prophet voice

* **High Reach / High ER:** Rare "Unicorn" (Builder \+ Photo \+ Origin \+ Community)

* **Low Reach / High ER:** Photo \+ AI Building/Career \+ Builder voice

* **Low Reach / Low ER:** Reshares, Host voice, polls, product updates

## **Goal Mismatch Warning**

When Reach Score is 9–10, **expect ER compression**. Judge by impressions and comment quality.

**Comment Quality Rubric:**

* **2 \= High:** Thoughtful disagreement, senior practitioners, inbound opportunities

* **1 \= Medium:** Supportive but generic

* **0 \= Low:** Off-topic, spam

# **Framework Applied: Scoring Real Posts**

## **Example 1: Meta DEI Rollback (Prophet)**

**Reach: 9/10** | Engagement: 5/10 | Topic: Social Commentary

**Prediction:** High reach (\>23,700), avg ER (1.8–4.0%)

**Actual:** 113,584 impressions, 0.53% ER. Reach accurate; ER lower (viral compression).

## **Example 2: Kindora Launch (Builder / Unicorn)**

**Reach: 5/10** | Engagement: 10/10 | Action: 7/10 | Topic: AI Building

**Prediction:** Moderate reach (3k–10.3k), high ER (\>4.7%)

**Actual:** 23,747 impressions, 5.76% ER. Reached "Unicorn" status—origin story traveled.

## **Example 3: Everyone Feels Unsafe (Prophet, no anchor)**

**Reach: 7/10** | Engagement: 5/10 | Topic: Social Commentary

**Prediction:** Top 25% reach (10.3k–23.7k)

**Actual:** 12,808 impressions. Proves Prophet voice works on intrinsic moral tension without big-name anchor.

# **Voice & Perspective Analysis**

## **What's Consistent Across All Your Posts**

* **Tension-seeking:** You gravitate toward paradoxes. You don't resolve tensions—you hold them up.

* **Embodied philosophy:** Abstract ideas get grounded in physical scenes.

* **Moral seriousness without moralizing:** Questions, not verdicts.

* **Credibility as subtext:** Authority present but rarely announced.

## **Voice Tagging Rules**

* Voice \= opening hook \+ dominant structure, not topic

* If blended, tag primary voice \+ secondary in notes

* Must pass the checklist to count as that voice

### **Prophet (Socratic) — Highest Reach**

**Characteristics:** Poetic, questioning, morally urgent. Prophet voice is Socratic: holds up tension, rarely resolves.

**Checklist:**

* Opens with event \+ moral tension

* Uses metaphor

* Avoids "should"; uses questioning

* No CTA (or in comments)

* Ends with answerable question

### **Builder — Highest Engagement**

**Characteristics:** Cinematic, vulnerable, specific. Must include a "transferable gift."

**Checklist:**

* Opens with scene (time/place)

* Real stakes

* Turning point

* Transferable lesson

* Gratitude / community invite

### **Teacher — Balanced**

**Characteristics:** Framework-oriented, practical. Risk: generic if not grounded in specific moments.

**Checklist:**

* Promises framework in opening

* Grounded in specific moment

* Structured takeaways

* Ends with "What would you add?"

### **Community Host — Niche**

**Characteristics:** Warm, invitational. Won't grow community without reach strategy.

**Checklist:**

* Clear invitation \+ logistics

* One clear CTA

* Accept lower reach as tradeoff

## **Voice Performance Matrix**

| Voice | n | Med. Reach | Avg Reach | Med. ER | Best For | Confidence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Prophet | 5 | 24,158 | 42,355 | 1.08% | Max reach | Low |
| Builder | 20 | 4,752 | 6,524 | 4.03% | Engagement | High |
| Teacher | 9 | 8,413 | 11,055 | 1.54% | Authority | Medium |
| Host | 8 | 2,746 | 3,232 | 2.43% | Community | Medium |

## **Voice Blend Recipes**

* **Prophet → Teacher:** Moral tension → framework → question

* **Builder → Teacher:** Scene → struggle → lesson → framework

* **Host → Builder:** Invite → origin story → invite

* **Teacher → Prophet:** Framework → ethical question

# **Strategic Recommendations**

## **For Maximum Reach**

* Lead with **Social Commentary pillar** (6x reach vs AI Building)

* Use **Prophet voice** \+ big-name anchor \+ timeliness

* Text-only, zero friction

## **For Maximum Engagement**

* Use **Builder voice** \+ photo \+ origin story

* Name people, invite community

* Include transferable lesson

## **For Kindora/Outdoorithm Awareness**

* Promote the problem, not the product

* Attach updates to broader hooks

## **Patterns to Avoid**

10 posts fell below median on BOTH reach AND engagement. Common patterns:

| ⚠️ High-Risk Combinations: Host voice \+ Reshare format: 4 of 10 underperformers. Consider commenting instead. Polls: Your single poll achieved only 0.92% ER. Avoid unless you have a specific reason. Product updates without story: Feature lists without origin stories underperform. Link posts: Posts where the primary content is a link preview perform poorly. |
| :---- |

## **Recommended Post Mix (6–8/month)**

* 1–2 Prophet posts (timed to news)

* 2–3 Builder posts (milestones, origin stories)

* 1–2 Teacher posts (frameworks)

* 1–2 Host posts (invitations)
