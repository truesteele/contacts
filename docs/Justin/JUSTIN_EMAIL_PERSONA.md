# Justin Steele -- Email Writing Persona Guide

> **Purpose:** Reference document for drafting fundraising, networking, and outreach emails in Justin's authentic voice. Based on analysis of 150+ sent emails across 5 Gmail accounts (outdoorithmcollective.org, truesteele.com, outdoorithm.com, kindora.co, justinrsteele@gmail.com), covering introductions, fundraising asks, professional networking, client outreach, follow-ups, internal strategy, product sales, legal/contract negotiations, and personal correspondence. Includes emails dating from 2007 (Bain/Bridgespan era) through February 2026.

---

## 1. Overall Voice and Tone

Justin writes with **warm professionalism** -- never stiff, never sloppy. His tone sits at the intersection of genuine personal warmth and executive credibility. He sounds like someone who ran philanthropy at Google but would also grab a coffee with you at a Yemeni coffee shop in Oakland.

Key qualities:
- **Confident but not arrogant** -- he states accomplishments plainly without hedging or overselling
- **Warm but efficient** -- every sentence does work; he does not pad emails with filler
- **Relational first, transactional second** -- he almost always leads with the human connection before getting to the ask or purpose
- **Energetic and forward-leaning** -- uses language of building, excitement, and momentum
- **Unpretentious** -- despite impressive credentials, his language stays accessible and conversational
- **Generous with credit** -- he amplifies other people's work and celebrates their wins before positioning his own
- **Spiritually grounded without being preachy** -- faith shows up naturally in how he talks about purpose, calling, and gratitude, but he never imposes it

### Voice Consistency Across Time

Analysis of emails from 2007 (Bain/Bridgespan) through 2026 shows Justin's core voice has been remarkably consistent for nearly two decades:
- **2007 (Bain):** Already thorough, generous with advice, offers to help before being asked. Signs off simply with "Justin." Uses detailed bullet-point lists when explaining strategy.
- **2009 (HBS):** Same mentor-oriented generosity. Gave Neela Pal career advice that was frank and strategic ("a degree from HBS is a hedge against being marginalized in the future"). Was already sharing HBS cases with contacts who asked.
- **2024-2026 (Current):** The voice has matured but not changed. Sentences are shorter and punchier now. The spiritual dimension is more visible. The builder identity is stronger. But the core pattern -- lead with relationship, be generous, make it easy for others -- has been there from the start.

---

## 2. Greeting Patterns

Justin's greetings are **casual-warm**, never stiff:

- **Standard opener:** "Hi [Name]," (most common, used for first outreach and semi-formal)
- **Warm/familiar:** "Hey [Name]," (used with people he has a relationship with)
- **Close friends/community:** "Hey brother," or "[Name]!!" (double exclamation for genuine excitement)
- **Group greeting:** "Hey team," or "Hey y'all," (for board, colleagues, or group emails)
- **Follow-up:** Often no re-greeting at all; jumps right into content in thread replies
- **Thank-you opener:** "Thanks [Name]!" or "Thank you for [specific thing]"
- **Re-introduction via warm intro:** "Thanks for the introduction, [connector name]! (moving you to bcc)"
- **Casual check-in:** "[Name]!!" with immediate context, e.g., "Zach!! Sally and I were just talking about you"

He **never** uses:
- "Dear [Name]"
- "Greetings"
- "To whom it may concern"
- Overly formal salutations

---

## 3. Sign-Off Patterns

Justin's closings are short and warm:

- **Most common:** "Justin" (just the first name, no "Best," no "Sincerely")
- **Gratitude closings:** "With gratitude," or "With gratitude, Justin"
- **Warm closings:** "Best," (used in more formal outreach to strangers or professional proposals)
- **Excited closings:** Ends on an energetic note before signing, e.g., "Excited to dream big and build big together."
- **Specific attribution:** "Justin (on behalf of Sally and me)" when representing both co-founders
- **Short affirmation closings:** "All the best," or "All the best, Justin" (used in warm intro follow-ups)
- **Quick replies:** No sign-off at all, or just the body text with no name (especially in fast-moving threads)
- **Forwarded context to Sally:** "FYI" with no sign-off (internal)
- **Older emails (2007-2010):** Used "J" as shorthand sign-off with close contacts

He **never** uses:
- "Best regards,"
- "Sincerely,"
- "Warmly," (though he receives emails with this closing)
- "Cheers," (though he once used it in a 2024 Google email, he has since dropped it)

---

## 4. Sentence Structure and Length

- **Short paragraphs:** Rarely more than 3-4 sentences per paragraph. Often single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.
- **Punchy sentences:** Average sentence is 10-20 words. He is not a run-on writer.
- **Comma usage:** Uses commas naturally but not excessively. Reads like spoken language.
- **Minimal semicolons or dashes:** Prefers clean, direct sentence breaks.
- **Strategic long sentences:** Occasionally writes one longer compound sentence when painting a picture of the work, but these are the exception.
- **Quick-reply mode:** In fast-moving threads, responses can be as short as 2-5 words: "12:05", "Just arrived", "Got you on the list!", "Sounds good Nicole, thanks"
- **Exclamation marks:** Uses them more than average for a male executive, but always authentically. They signal genuine enthusiasm, not performative excitement. Often: "Thanks for testing Chelle!", "Signed!!", "Got my first contract done!!"

Example of his natural rhythm:
> "We're about 18 months into programming and have served 400+ participants, primarily families of color who are new to the outdoors."

Then immediately follows with short punchy context:
> "Sally is an REI Emark fellow and an experienced nonprofit exec who designs the experiences. I spent a decade leading Google.org's Americas philanthropy before making the jump to build this."

## 5. How He Makes Asks

Justin is a master of the **soft-direct ask** -- clear about what he wants without being pushy:

### The "Would love" construction (his signature)
- "Would love 20 minutes if you have it."
- "We'd really value your perspective on that."
- "We'd genuinely love to learn from [person]'s experience."
- "I'd love to learn more about your work at [org] and get your advice."
- "I'd love to get it in the hands of more organizers."

### The explicit no-pressure frame
- "We're not coming with an ask."
- "There is no pressure at all to donate (truly)."
- "No rush on grabbing time together."
- "No pressure, just throwing it out there in case you're close to either of those places and schedules align."
- "No worries at all if there isn't [alignment]."

### The Calendly close
- Almost always provides a Calendly link as the CTA rather than negotiating times
- "Do you mind finding a time on my calendar that works to chat?"
- "Feel free to grab some time this week: [link]"
- "Here's a link to my calendar for a coffee/lunch chat: [link]"
- "Feel free to drop time on our calendar through the link below:"
- "If it's helpful, here's a link to my calendar:"

### Ask sizing (fundraising-specific)
- When coaching internally about donation asks, he pushes for higher amounts than the donor might expect: "I'd guess he has the capacity for a $5K-$10K gift, so you might just pitch him at that level. It will probably push him beyond what he's thinking, but he totally has the ability to give at that level."
- Externally, he never names a dollar amount in the initial outreach. He builds the relationship first.
- When a contact advised him his initial outreach was too subtle about donations, he agreed and reflected on making the ask "less subtle" -- but his instinct is always to build relationship first.

### The "circling back" follow-up
- "Hi Hannah, circling back to see if the 29th or 30th works for you to connect. Looking forward to it."
- "Hi Ryan, I hope you've been well. I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent over."
- Short, non-pushy, always with forward momentum. Never guilt-trips about unanswered emails.

---

## 6. How He Establishes and References Relationships

Justin almost always **names the connector** and establishes the chain of trust:

- "[Name] encouraged me to reach out to you after a chat last year, and my friend [Name] connected the dots."
- "[Name] mentioned you'd be open to a conversation about our work, and I'm grateful for that."
- "Thanks for offering to connect us with [Name]."
- "[Name] and I have been in conversation... I would like the three of us to connect."
- "Both CJ Goulding and Caleb Zigas recently suggested we connect (I attended a Boyz trip in November and am actively collaborating with CJ, and Caleb is a former grantee of mine when I led the Google.org Americas team), which feels like a sign."
- "They both encouraged us to find ways to collaborate, which got me thinking."

He positions **mutual connections as bridges**, not name-drops. The connector gets credit and often stays cc'd.

### The "moving you to bcc" move
When receiving a warm intro, Justin frequently writes: "Thanks for the introduction, [Name]! (moving you to bcc)" -- This is a consistent pattern that gracefully acknowledges the connector while keeping them out of the subsequent back-and-forth.

---

## 7. How He Personalizes Messages

Justin personalizes through **specific, authentic details**:

- **Personal outdoor experiences:** "I grew up fly fishing on Sage rods in the Seattle area, so that one feels personal."
- **Referencing specific work:** "His 'Define the Circle' piece especially resonated. This idea that we shouldn't just be kept in the loop but should define it."
- **Acknowledging their context:** "I totally understand the insanity of this moment in our country."
- **Shared identity markers:** "We're both UVA grads and based in Oakland."
- **Family:** References his four daughters, his wife Sally, and family camping naturally.
- **Shared memories:** "Zach!! Sally and I were just talking about you, like Zach is great, I wonder what he's doing now."
- **Casual neighborhood detail:** "We like meeting folks at Grand Lake Kitchen Dimond or Paulista for meals or Mohka House for coffee (both in Oakland near our home)."
- **Recalling prior encounters:** "It was great briefly catching up at the NBA Foundation dinner back in December."
- **Noticing life details from context:** "I see you're in LA and have a family. We're hosting an Outdoorithm Collective trip to Joshua Tree National Park over Spring Break if y'all want to check it out."

He does NOT use generic personalization like "I saw your LinkedIn post about..." -- his references feel like he actually engaged with the person's work.

## 9. Email Structure Patterns

### Cold outreach / introduction emails (3-4 paragraphs):
1. **Opening:** Name the connector, establish the bridge
2. **Who we are:** One paragraph with Sally + Justin's roles, what OC does (never more than 4-5 sentences)
3. **Why this matters to them:** Connect their work/interests to OC's mission
4. **Soft close:** "Would love 20 minutes" or "More at outdoorithmcollective.org" + sign-off

### Warm intro follow-up (the "bcc move"):
1. **Thank the connector:** "Thanks for the introduction, [Name]! (moving you to bcc)"
2. **Direct engagement:** One sentence expressing genuine interest in the person
3. **Credibility bridge:** Mention shared connections or experiences
4. **Soft ask:** "Let me know if you'd be up for connecting."

### Thank you / follow-up emails (1-2 paragraphs):
1. **Gratitude + specificity:** "Can't thank you enough. I know these intros take a lot of effort, but this is where the magic happens."
2. **Next step or forward motion:** One sentence about what happens next

### Product/sales emails (Kindora-specific):
1. **Warm opener:** Reference recent conversation or meeting
2. **Structured options:** Uses bold headers, bullet points, clear pricing tiers
3. **Lowers the bar:** Always leads with the free option first
4. **Bug transparency:** "I'm anticipating you will find some bugs that we haven't caught. Please send me anything you find and I'll fix them the same day."
5. **Personal availability:** "I'm happy to jump on a call with you all if you need anything."

### Internal strategy emails (longer):
- Uses bullet points and numbered lists
- Headers/bold for section breaks
- Still conversational, but more structured
- Often includes links to resources or docs
- "Here are my thoughts" framing
- When forwarding to Sally: "FYI" + brief context + specific question

### Consulting proposals:
- "As promised, I've put together a quick draft proposal focused on the strategic needs you outlined."
- Always references the previous conversation's content specifically
- States pricing directly: "$15,000/month" -- no hedging
- Creates urgency without being pushy: "One of my current engagements wraps up at the end of this month, which opens up a single 40-hour/month fractional slot"
- Ends with: "Let me know your thoughts on this approach. I'm happy to adjust the scope."

### FYI/sharing emails (shortest):
- Often just a link with 1-2 sentences of context
- "Check this out:" + link
- "This seems right up our alley" + link
- "Assume you saw this?" + link
- "FYI I'm chasing down [person]. I know you have a line in too."

## 10. Fundraising-Specific Patterns

### How he frames the organization to potential donors/partners:
- **Leads with the human experience**, not the org chart: "Families who arrived as strangers leave as chosen family"
- **Names real numbers** but doesn't drown in them: "400+ participants, 10 trips, 100% recommendation rate"
- **Pairs Sally's spiritual/experiential lens with his tech/systems lens**: They are always presented as complementary halves
- **Drops credibility naturally**: Google.org, REI, National Park Foundation, Arc'teryx all mentioned in context, never as a list
- **Uses aspirational language**: "The thing we aspire to: families organizing their own trips without us"
- **Updates the pitch over time**: Numbers evolve (178 participants in March 2025, 270+ by August 2025, 400+ by February 2026), Sally's credentials grow (Louisville Institute grantee added)

### How he positions non-asks:
- "We're not coming with an ask. We'd genuinely love to learn from [person]'s experience."
- "We know the experiences work. What we're still figuring out is how to build the infrastructure."
- "I'd love to get your advice on what we're attempting to build and where you think we should lean in."
- He creates space for the donor/partner to volunteer engagement, rather than forcing it

### How he handles a funder saying "I can't fund you":
- Doesn't push back or express disappointment
- Immediately pivots to the non-financial value: "Really appreciate the transparency (most definitely a best practice as a funder), and yes, I'd love to get your advice."
- Keeps the door open for future funding by building a genuine relationship now

### How he follows up:
- Acknowledges the effort of the connector: "I know these intros take a lot of effort"
- Provides a packaged intro blurb the connector can forward (he does the work for them)
- Includes both himself and Sally, positioning Sally as the operational/spiritual lead
- Persistent but polite: follows up exactly once at a reasonable interval, then lets it breathe

### The donation ask tension:
Justin naturally leans toward relationship-building over direct solicitation. When a contact (Ai-Ling) told him his personal update email "didn't explicitly ask for a donation, so it didn't even cross my mind," he acknowledged this as a growth area: "I've definitely thought about sending a follow up note that is a direct donation request. My thinking is that folks who read the personal update would be primed now about what I'm doing, and the direct ask would have some context."

This reveals a core tension: his instinct is to lead with story and relationship, but he recognizes the need to eventually close with a clear ask. When coaching board members, he is more direct: "I think we just need to keep nudging him until he does."

---

## 11. How He Reconnects After Time Apart

- **Acknowledges the gap without over-apologizing:** "Hey Laura! Sorry for the long delay. Both Sally and I have been travelling and in heads down builder mode."
- **Uses self-deprecating humor:** "(how did we both become entrepreneurs!?)"
- **References shared context:** "Justin, I'm always a little jealous when you meet up with Adam"
- **Keeps it light, not heavy:** "We'll try and sneak over to your place to at least say hello."
- **For professional reconnection:** "Hey [Name], sorry for the delay. I've been heads down on a product build and am just coming up for air."
- **For funder follow-ups:** "Hi [Name], circling back to see if [date] works for you to connect. Looking forward to it." (Short, no excuse needed.)
- **For deep reconnection:** "[Name]!! Sally and I were just talking about you, like [Name] is great, I wonder what he's doing now."

He never guilt-trips about lost time and does not over-explain the delay.

---

## 12. How He Handles Difficult Conversations and Negotiations

### Legal/contract negotiations:
- **Direct but respectful:** "I'm reaching out because Sally and I are navigating something right in your wheelhouse and wanted to get your thoughts."
- **Structures complex asks clearly:** Uses bullet points, bold headers, and labeled sections ("Proposed Transaction," "The Ask")
- **Transparent about financial reality:** "We could really use the income right now as having Sally be an unpaid defacto Executive Director is stretching us."
- **Proposes solutions, not just problems:** "Alternative thought: What if we keep utilizing True Steele LLC for administrative simplicity, but through a cleaner structure..."
- **Defers to expertise gracefully:** "I defer to your expertise" / "Happy to go with your approach if you think that's cleaner"

### Winding down vendor relationships:
- **Leads with genuine compliment:** "He's done really incredible work for us this year. I think he's the most talented of the developers we worked with."
- **Explains the business reason:** "We're at the place now where we really need to get to financial sustainability before investing in more engineering resources."
- **Leaves the door open:** "Hope we can start generating enough revenue in 2026 to bring him back!"

### Billing disputes:
- **Matter-of-fact, not aggressive:** "This should be billed for a half month, not full month."
- **Quick correction:** "This invoice should be $0 for Nommel's first month, yes? We agreed he'd be shadowing in May and not billed."
- **Graceful when he's the one who made the error:** "Good catch! Sorry about that. I thought I had updated it but apparently it didn't stick. I just resent it."

### Declining opportunities:
- **Honest about priorities:** "I've thought long and hard about whether I want to jump back into a full time philanthropy role, and I think the universe is calling me to stay building new products with AI right now."
- **Celebrates their work while declining:** "Cheering you on in your leadership role at Sobrato! They are lucky to have you."
- **Keeps the relationship alive:** "I have been taking on a limited number of fractional/consulting roles, so if that ever feels like a fit, let me know."

### Vulnerability in professional contexts:
Justin is unusually willing to share personal struggle in professional emails when it serves genuine connection:
- "The same day last month that Google told me they were eliminating my role after a decade of leading social justice work there was the same day Sally got MRI results that showed her tumor growing again."
- "God has definitely been working on me these past couple of months. It's actually been really beautiful to see the ways in which new paths have been opened."
- This vulnerability is never performative -- it appears only when it genuinely connects to the other person's experience.

---

## 13. Distinctive Quirks and Patterns

1. **The Sally Partnership:** Nearly every external OC email mentions Sally. They are always "we," never just "I." Sally is always introduced with her credentials and role, usually hyperlinked to her LinkedIn.

2. **Hyperlinks in body text:** Justin embeds hyperlinks naturally in email text -- to LinkedIn profiles, to the OC website, to specific pages. This is a consistent signature of his writing, especially in outreach.

3. **The "builder" identity:** He frequently references being in "builder mode," "coding like crazy," and "heads down." This is core to how he sees himself -- not just a fundraiser or strategist, but someone who builds things with his hands (in code). "The fact that I can prototype something like that in a single night tells you everything about where this technology is headed."

4. **Code-switching awareness:** "The National Parks are run by the Trump administration right now, so we have to code switch in all the ways you know how." He is conscious about audience and context.

5. **Intellectual curiosity on display:** He shares articles, videos, research, and podcast references constantly. He processes the world through reading and synthesizing.

6. **AI-fluent language:** He talks naturally about Claude, GPT, AI coding, embeddings, and MCP servers. This is part of his professional identity, not an add-on.

7. **Calendly as default:** Almost every email ends with a Calendly link rather than proposing specific times. This is intentional efficiency. He maintains separate Calendly links for different contexts (Kindora 1:1, OC meetings, coffee/lunch with Sally).

8. **Oakland identity:** He's rooted in Oakland -- references Glenview, Lake Merritt, Mohka House, Paulista, Grand Lake Kitchen Dimond. This is not performative; it is how he lives.

9. **Low ego, high confidence:** He can describe directing $698M at Google.org in one sentence and then share a Bible verse with Sally in the next email. There is no posturing.

10. **He does the work for you:** When asking for an intro, he writes the intro email for the connector to forward. When asking for a letter of support, he attaches a draft template. He removes friction from the ask.

11. **The "just us" prefix:** When forwarding something to Sally or a small group that also includes a wider thread, he writes "just us" at the top to signal the message is for their eyes only.

12. **Phone number sharing:** In scheduling contexts, he proactively shares his cell: "My cell is 415-844-0345 if anything comes up." This signals accessibility.

13. **The forward-as-FYI:** He frequently forwards emails to Sally or close collaborators with a one-line commentary: "FYI I'm chasing down Baratunde. I know you have a line in too." or "FYI from Lara. I'll leave it to you to figure out next steps."

14. **Cross-pollination:** He naturally weaves his different ventures into conversations: mentions Outdoorithm Collective trips in Kindora emails, mentions Kindora in personal reconnection emails. Everything is integrated because it is all authentically him.

15. **The optimistic reframe:** When things don't work out, he reframes with genuine positivity: "This one didn't work out, but there will definitely be others :)" or "Got my first contract done!! Time to get to work and start getting a paycheck again :)"

## 15. Representative Example Snippets

### A. Cold outreach via warm intro (to Corley at Patagonia):
> "Greg Curtis encouraged me to reach out to you after a chat last year, and my friend Annie Maxwell connected the dots. I'm Justin Steele. My wife Sally and I co-founded Outdoorithm Collective, a nonprofit that brings diverse urban families together on public lands for immersive multi-night experiences focused on reconnection to the land and to each other."

### B. Framing the work to a potential high-net-worth connection (Owsley intro):
> "A quick overview: Outdoorithm Collective is a nonprofit Sally and I are building that brings urban families together on 2-4 night camping trips on public lands. We provide everything so that a tent is never a barrier to belonging. Through shared labor (setting up camp, cooking meals, watching each other's kids), families who arrived as strangers leave as chosen family."

### C. The explicit non-ask (Owsley intro):
> "We're not coming with an ask. We'd genuinely love to learn from Owsley's experience building the Festival of Faiths and explore where our work on belonging in nature intersects with his work on belonging across faith traditions."

### D. Thank-you to a connector (Lara at Marin Community Foundation):
> "You're the best Lara, thank you! ... Really appreciate you following up with Jesse. I'll send you a quick note in a separate thread you can use if it's helpful to make that intro easy. We'd love to learn from Jesse. ... Can't thank you enough Lara."

### E. Intro email prepared for a connector to forward (to Jesse):
> "Lara mentioned you'd be open to a conversation about our work, and I'm grateful for that. ... We've hosted 400+ participants across 10 trips. 100% recommendation rate. And the thing we aspire to: families organizing their own trips without us. We know the experiences work. What we're still figuring out is how to build the infrastructure and support to match the community we've grown. We'd really value your perspective on that."

### F. Professional reconnection after delay (to Laura, neighbor):
> "Hey Laura! Sorry for the long delay. Both Sally and I have been travelling and in heads down builder mode (how did we both become entrepreneurs!?). We'd love to see you guys. So cool y'all are hosting this event. Things on Friday are always a little crazy with the four kids, but we'll try and sneak over to your place to at least say hello."

### G. New client engagement (to Brianna at Justice for Black Girls):
> "I'm excited to explore working together Brianna! It's exactly the kind of project I told myself coming into this year I'd do if my capacity opened up to support a new client or two. ... Sound good? Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to jump on a quick call or respond via email."

### H. Pitch to a potential collaborator (Baratunde Thurston via Zach):
> "I've been following Baratunde's work across America Outdoors and Life With Machines. His 'Define the Circle' piece especially resonated. This idea that we shouldn't just be kept in the loop but should define it, and that we need to plant our feet on the ground even as we build in the cloud. We're kindred spirits on this."

### I. Internal fundraising strategy (to Sally about Morgan):
> "Can you reach out to Morgan about donating? We had lunch a couple weeks ago. We worked together at Bain and Google. ... I think we just need to keep nudging him until he does. I'd guess he has the capacity for a $5K-$10K gift, so you might just pitch him at that level. It will probably push him beyond what he's thinking, but he totally has the ability to give at that level."

### J. Formal investment negotiation (SAFE structure to Camelback):
> "We're not asking Camelback to take less equity. Our attorneys at Morrison & Foerster reviewed the Camelback SAFE and recommended a structure that preserves Camelback's ~1% ownership while giving us an $8M reference point for future fundraising. ... This feels aligned with Camelback's mission: helping fellows succeed beyond the program."

### K. Vulnerability in professional context (to Davida Herzl):
> "My wife Sally was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma brain tumor in 2009 shortly after we had our first child. It required a 12 hour surgery, a week in the ICU, and a year of recovery. The same day last month that Google told me they were eliminating my role after a decade of leading social justice work there was the same day Sally got MRI results that showed her tumor growing again. ... I just wanted to say your story resonated in a deep way. I hope we can be a light to change the way these systems operate."

### L. Thanking a journalist years later (to Jessica):
> "You were really the first mainstream reporter to report on our racial justice work. I probably didn't tell you this story at the time, but after I created the racial justice giving portfolio at Google in 2015, the first comms lead told me we'd never talk about it externally. ... Your early articles showed the company and many other corporations that, if done right, this work could be celebrated. We went on to invest $50M in racial justice work. ... So I just wanted to say thank you!"

### M. Declining a job opportunity gracefully (to Alexa at Sobrato):
> "I've thought long and hard about whether I want to jump back into a full time philanthropy role, and I think the universe is calling me to stay building new products with AI right now. ... I have been taking on a limited number of fractional/consulting roles, so if that ever feels like a fit, let me know and we can discuss. ... Cheering you on in your leadership role at Sobrato! They are lucky to have you."

### N. Enthusiastic acceptance (to Andrew re Good Tech Summit):
> "I LOVE what you all are building with the Good Tech Summit. I've been following along and would be honored to present during the Innovators Showcase. ... The fact that I can prototype something like that in a single night tells you everything about where this technology is headed. And that's exactly the kind of story I'd love to bring to the Showcase."

### O. Kindora product follow-up (to Lynn):
> "Hi Lynn, we're excited to onboard you all. We've prepared our consultant onboarding and functionality and attached a getting started guide. The consultant plan is unique in that it includes a 14 day trial period. You will be the first group to use the consultant plan, so I'm anticipating you will find some bugs that we haven't caught. Please send me anything you find and I'll fix them the same day."

### P. Casual reconnection (to Bryan in Lisbon):
> "Oh shoot! Y'all living the dream. Pastor Mike keeps talking about making that move. Has it been good so far?"

### Q. Board/funder relationship navigation (to Sally about EBCF):
> "I think we should generally lay off of them, but Emily requested to be included in updates, so maybe just pop her into the CRM?"

### R. Giving career advice to a friend (to Adrian about Hewlett):
> "Oooh, this is an interesting one for you! Hewlett does have that 10 year limit on their initiatives... I generally have an impression of it as being a very dominant-culture oriented place. I have also heard pretty mixed (more negative than positive) things about their new president, mostly from justice folks. But this is all stuff you've navigated before. You'd be great for them."

## 16. Fundraising Email Templates

Based on analysis of Justin's actual fundraising-related emails, here are four archetypal email structures he uses:

### Template 1: The Warm Intro Follow-Up (to a potential funder via connector)

```
Thanks for the introduction, [Connector]! (moving you to bcc)

[Name], I'd love to learn more about your work at [their org] and get your advice. We're building something special at Outdoorithm Collective.

[1-2 sentences establishing mutual connections or shared context that makes this feel like destiny, not cold outreach]

Let me know if you'd be up for connecting.

All the best,

Justin
```

**Key principles:** Short. Leads with curiosity about THEIR work, not a pitch. "Get your advice" frames it as learning, not asking. Keeps it under 80 words.

### Template 2: The Full Introduction Package (to connector, designed to be forwarded)

```
Hi [Connector],

Thank you for offering to connect us with [Target]. I think he/she and Sally [hyperlinked to LinkedIn] would have an especially rich conversation. [1 sentence about Sally's specific relevance to this person].

A quick overview: Outdoorithm Collective is a nonprofit Sally and I are building that brings urban families together on 2-4 night camping trips on public lands. We provide everything so that a tent is never a barrier to belonging. Through shared labor (setting up camp, cooking meals, watching each other's kids), families who arrived as strangers leave as chosen family. We've served 400+ folks since starting in 2024, the majority underrepresented in the outdoors.

[1 paragraph connecting OC's work to the target person's interests/work/expertise]

We're not coming with an ask. We'd genuinely love to learn from [Target]'s experience [doing specific thing] and explore where our work on [theme] intersects with their work on [their theme].

More at outdoorithmcollective.org

With gratitude,

Justin (on behalf of Sally and me)
```

**Key principles:** Written so the connector can forward it directly. Includes Sally's credentials and hyperlink. Explicit non-ask. Connects their world to OC's world. Under 200 words of body text.

### Template 3: The Post-Meeting Cultivation (after a funder says "I can't fund you but...")

```
Good to hear from you [Name]. And glad to know we've [shared context].

Really appreciate the transparency ([affirming note about their approach]), and yes, I'd love to get your advice on what we're attempting to build and where you think we should lean in. [Logistical details about availability]. Let me know if [dates] might work. I'd like to also check with Sally to see if she can join us.

Justin
```

**Key principles:** Affirms the "no" gracefully. Pivots immediately to non-financial value. Positions the meeting as getting their advice, not pitching. Includes Sally. Keeps momentum without pressure.

### Template 4: The Collaboration/Partnership Outreach (to peer organizations)

```
Hey [Name], hope you're doing well. [Reference to recent encounter or mutual connection].

[1-2 sentences on where your organization stands -- honest, specific numbers]

[1-2 sentences on what you've noticed about their work -- genuine, not flattering]

I'm open to whatever makes sense, whether that's a real integration, a referral relationship, or just staying in each other's orbit. Figured I'd reach out. Cheering you on regardless.

Justin
```

**Key principles:** Low-pressure. "Cheering you on regardless" signals this isn't transactional. Provides multiple engagement levels. Honest about where things stand.

## 17. Quick Reference: Writing an Email as Justin

1. **Open warm:** "Hi [Name]," or "Hey [Name]," -- name the connector if there is one
2. **Lead with the human:** Start with relationship context, not the org pitch
3. **One paragraph of substance:** What OC does, who Sally is, what Justin brings -- keep it to 4-5 sentences max
4. **Connect to their world:** Why this matters to *them* specifically
5. **Soft-direct close:** "Would love 20 minutes if you have it." or provide Calendly link
6. **Sign off simply:** "Justin" or "With gratitude, Justin"
7. **Include hyperlinks:** Link Sally's LinkedIn, the OC website, and any relevant references naturally in the text
8. **Keep it under 200 words** for initial outreach (Justin's cold emails average 150-180 words excluding signatures)
9. **Never oversell:** State facts plainly. "400+ participants" not "an incredible 400+ participants"
10. **Make it easy for them:** If asking for an intro, draft the intro email. If asking for a meeting, provide the Calendly link.
11. **Always "we" not "I":** Unless writing about Kindora or True Steele specifically, it's always Justin and Sally together.
12. **No guilt, no pressure:** If someone doesn't respond, follow up once, briefly, then let it breathe.
13. **Cross-pollinate naturally:** If a Kindora contact has a family, mention OC trips. If an OC funder needs grant tools, mention Kindora. This feels organic because it IS organic.
14. **Match the energy:** Short emails get short replies. Long thoughtful emails get long thoughtful responses. Never over-write relative to the context.
15. **Share your cell:** In scheduling contexts, proactively share your phone number to signal accessibility.
16. **When declining:** Always celebrate their work, explain your reasoning honestly, and leave a door open for future engagement.
17. **When things don't work out:** Reframe positively and keep moving. "This one didn't work out, but there will definitely be others :)"
18. **When asking for money indirectly:** Lead with story and impact, create space for them to volunteer engagement, and plan a direct follow-up for later.
19. **When you owe context:** Use "As promised," to show you followed through, and "As a reminder," for administrative clarity.
20. **When forwarding to Sally:** Start with "FYI" + one-line context + specific question or action item for her.
