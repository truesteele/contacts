# Year-End Email: Final Version (Ready to Send)

**Subject line:** A personal year-end hello (and a beach football game)

---

Hi {{FirstName}},

Two days after Thanksgiving, I watched a group of boys (some of whom had never seen the ocean) playing football on the beach at Half Moon Bay.

Strangers on Friday. Teammates by Saturday.

Our three older girls jumped in. The adults stood back with coffee, watching pure joy unfold in a place that hasn't always felt accessible or welcoming to families like theirs.

That moment is a pretty good summary of my 2025.

Many of you know that late last year, after nearly a decade leading Google.org's Americas philanthropy, my role was eliminated. It hurt. And it clarified what I wanted to build next.

What I didn't expect was the outpouring that followed: messages, calls, letters from colleagues and community leaders. It reminded me that the work is carried by people, not institutions. If you were one of those people: thank you.

I chose not to take severance, which meant I had to move quickly. Here's what I built:

• **Outdoorithm Collective** is a nonprofit I'm building with my wife Sally to help families reconnect with the land and each other. Half Moon Bay was one of our best trips yet: 35 people, cold air, warm fire, and a weekend I don't think any of us will forget. We also built Outdoorithm.com, a "Green Book" for public camping that helps families plan trips on their own.

• **Kindora** is a public benefit corporation I'm building with my co-founder Karibu Nyaggah (we've been friends since Harvard Business School in 2003). Kindora uses AI to help small nonprofits find aligned funders. I know what it feels like to have a program that matters, barely any money in the bank, and no time to prospect. We launched in August, grew to 215+ organizations through word-of-mouth, and just moved to paid plans. We welcomed our first outside investor and are exploring whether additional capital makes sense in 2026.

• **True Steele** is my fractional Chief Impact Officer practice. I've spent the year helping organizations like Flourish Fund, a faith-driven fund investing in foster care, navigate the real tensions of systemic change: staying accountable to communities while meeting funder expectations.

If I'm sitting with anything as the year closes, it's this: I used to think a corporate paycheck was the definition of security. This year taught me that certainty is always borrowed. Building has been exhilarating, and at times terrifying, especially while raising four kids.

But I'd rather take the risk on something I'm building than on someone else's org chart.

**Looking ahead:** In 2026, we want to grow Outdoorithm in two ways: bring more families into the Collective, and build a small circle of supporters who want to make outdoor equity real, not just aspirational. And we're focused on scaling Kindora to reach the thousands of nonprofits who need it.

**A small invitation:** If any of this resonates, I'd love to hear from you. Even a quick reply helps. I'll follow up with a short overview and the simplest next step.

• **OUTDOOR** if you want to hear how families can join, or you're open to a conversation about supporting our trips
• **KINDORA** if you want a demo, know a nonprofit that should try it, or are curious about investing as we grow
• **HELLO** if you just want to reconnect (I'd genuinely love to hear what you've been up to)

Wishing you and yours a meaningful close to 2025.

With gratitude,
Justin
