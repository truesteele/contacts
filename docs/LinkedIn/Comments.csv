Then I remember going through engineering school with a TI-89 that solved differential equations I couldn't solve by hand. Nobody said my degree was meaningless because the calculator did the calculus. There's a balance for sure, but that calculator made me better because I could focus on the systems instead of the algebra. AI is like the TI-89 for everything."

From inside our Kindora build: Claude Code writes tests alongside features. 111 backend test files, Playwright E2E on every PR, Row-Level Security on every table, OWASP-aligned security tests, dual API auth, Redis rate limiting. The AI suggested most of those patterns at my prompting.

Doctorow's enshittification thesis is about extraction. Platforms lure users in, then shift value to shareholders. But that cycle depends on who owns the platform. If the builders are from the community they serve and the users are their neighbors, the incentive to extract looks different. Kindora is a Public Benefit Corporation for this reason. Shareholders can't sue us for prioritizing community value over profit. That's a structural answer to enshittification, not just a cultural one.

Right now I'm focused on prototype, production, and the beginning of the growth curve. Will we need more engineers as we climb? Probably. But by then you have revenue and leverage. Old model: raise millions before you build, then answer to whoever gave you the money. New model: build first, prove it works, bring in capital on your terms."

Political problems are harder because they're about power, not efficiency, as you know. But I think they're more connected than they appear. The school funding example is perfect. Property tax funding isn't just policy, it's wealth concentration coded into infrastructure. My hope is that if we can break through on building and create real economic power in our communities, the political power follows. Money talks in those rooms. But that requires funders to stop treating our builders like charity cases and start seeding them like the startup ecosystem they are. That's the capital section of this piece and honestly the part that keeps me up at night."

SQL queries can definitely get you far.

The non-990 funder search is a multi-step beast: source lists (Chronicle of Philanthropy, SF Business Times, accelerator alumni, etc.), build website scraping and deep research tools, use AI reasoning models to structure the data, then deduplicate everything. AI helps a lot, but there's no shortcut there.

Real-time grant opportunities are solvable at small scale. Check out Firecrawl's agent scraper. Much better than browse.ai (which I've also used). Works great until you need to monitor 50,000 websites. Then it gets cost prohibitive, and we're trying hard to keep costs low.

Would love to chat. DM me and let's find time."
2026-01-23 03:25:28,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7420218859292475392,"Taylor Williamson Love seeing you take the leap into the data! Hope others follow.

At Kindora, basic 990 search is free. It's public data. We charge for the AI layer, but \"who funded what\" shouldn't live behind a paywall.

The two hardest problems beyond where you've landed:

1) The matching problem: 70% of 990 filers don't report grantee EINs, so all you have is a name (often a misspelled, abbreviated one). It took weeks of ML jujitsu for me to crack that.

2) The visibility problem: When Nick and I started at Google.org, we gave through the Google Foundation (990 filer). Google shut that down around 2017. Now none of its grantees show up in public filings now. Had to build a whole smart system to catalogue these \"dark funders,\" which is more and more funders these these days.

The goal is to elevate folks with proximity to problems over proximity to power. The nonprofits closest to communities shouldn't be the ones locked out of the intelligence that wins grants.

Been having a blast building this. Up next: real-time intel on which opportunities are open right now for your specific organization. Thanks to Jose Gordon and his awesome team for helping me build that as part of the AWS social entrepreneur accelerator."

As a former funder, I know how idiosyncratic decisions can be. It's very hard to predict whether a grant will be awarded. So you need to go high volume.

The work falls through foundation cracks: environmental funding goes to conservation; youth funding goes to poverty. What exists at the intersection? I saw this leading at Google.org. Orgs that don't fit the strategy-as-articulated are nearly impossible to fund. But that just means we need to redefine the category.

Outdoorithm Collective organizes group camping trips for urban families on public land (400+ folks so far) and uses tech to help them figure out where to go, what to bring, and how to find community. Positive sentiment everywhere. Resources almost nowhere.

I'd love to see a call to fund this work, so communities whose relationship to the land was intentionally severed can experience nature not just as visitors, but as stewards of public lands that belong to them as much as anyone."

I'm learning this the hard way. At Outdoorithm Collective, we're building a social platform rooted in outdoor community, not data extraction. AI lets us build something world class at lower cost than ever before. But it's still not free. Hosting costs money. API calls cost money. Security reviews cost money.

Yesterday a funder loved what we're building, shared a list of their grantees who would benefit from it, then declined to help us pay for it (at least at this stage, which is when we need it the most).

Until philanthropy treats tech infrastructure like real infrastructure, values alignment stays aspirational.

I often times felt at Google that my mentors and my ancestors were with me in those board rooms both cheering me on but also holding me accountable to be loyal to the sacrifices they made and the values they instilled. 

This excerpt from a Thomas Merton poem in Richard Rohr's Falling Upward has been a constant source of encouragement to me as I've navigated a path beyond Google.

Be still:
There is no longer any need of comment.
It was a lucky wind
That blew away his halo with his cares,
A lucky sea that drowned his reputation.

It's been a year out here in the wild for me, and it's been beautiful, energizing, and terrifying all at once. And exactly where I need to be. I trust you will find your way as well! Let me know if I can be helpful as you navigate your path."

What's struck me since leaving is how little funding exists for something more basic: the ability to trust strangers. To bridge difference. Not upward mobility but lateral connection.

That's what we keep running into at Outdoorithm Collective. The serving you describe changes lives. But there's almost no funding for the infrastructure that helps people see each other as neighbors instead of threats.

The landscape barely has a category for that, much less resources."

In my opinion, the initiatives you cited shouldn't require philanthropy at all. Fair wages for annotators, compensating creators for training data, managing environmental impacts, that's just responsible operations.

There's good thinking out there about this transition, but I keep coming back to how dignity and worth are tied to creating value for others.

During 2015-2022, there was real momentum. Companies funded narrative-shifting work like Equal Justice Initiative's lynching memorial. Some took on criminal justice reform, examined structural racism, questioned concentrated wealth.

Patagonia's Holdfast Collective and Ben & Jerry's still push boundaries. Costco held firm when 98% of shareholders backed them in January. 

I've also been deeply impressed by REI's Dan Kihanya and Susan Viscon - they're still backing founders historically excluded from the outdoor industry, building real community through Path Ahead Ventures despite all the headwinds. That takes courage.

But overall the tide has pulled back, and most companies have retreated to safer shores.

This work moves in cycles. When the tide's out - like now - you adjust your menu. When it rushes back in, and it will, you ride the front of that wave with everything you've prepared."

On #1, my hunch is it's about both wealth concentration (can't tech our way out of that) and declining relational trust. We're experimenting at Outdoorithm Collective using AI to help people find and trust each other in community works, but it's upstream infrastructure work, not a quick fix.

On #2 and #3 together: I think better storytelling could close the empathy gap. If donors saw 2-minute founder videos instead of 20-page reports, maybe expectations would shift toward partnership rather than transactional accountability? And the cascade problem might actually be a targeting problem. We all hate ads, but we appreciate being shown the right thing at the right moment. What if AI surfaced causes when people are actually ready to engage, not just blasting them constantly?

#4 connects most directly to what we're building at Kindora: normalize AI-generated reporting so small teams can focus on relationships instead of paperwork. That's the unlock. Automate the drudgery, preserve the human connection."

When your clients overcome paralysis and start giving, are they discovering small, community-rooted organizations? Or more often gravitating toward the well-branded/trusted nonprofits?

When you're sitting on hundreds of grant applications, you lean on trust signals. It's not necessarily wrong. Trust is everything. The problem is whose vouch counts.

At Google.org, family offices would quietly follow my grant lists all the time. It moved millions. But what about your vouch CJ? You have proximity those donors will never have. Your endorsement should carry just as much weight.

Stanley's rubrics help. Panels can help defend decisions. But the new org with messy books and breakthrough ideas rarely survives committee consensus. If I had to put all my grants through committee at Google, I'll bet some of my best work would have been blocked.

The real fix (imho): democratize the vouch itself. Make trust visible—publish who vouched and why. Disclose conflicts. Let funders follow trusted leaders like you openly, not through backchannels.

I've been thinking about taking a swing at some tech that could do this.

The old boys' network works because vouching is an efficient way to signal trust. We need to make equitable vouching just as efficient.

What I'm seeing: organizations post full-time roles, can't find the right fit or budget, then someone suggests \"what about fractional?\" Often it's an \"aha\" moment. They get senior strategic thinking without the full-time commitment.

Most of my work has been with smaller foundations and impact orgs. Sometimes I'll see a posted role, reach out, and ask \"Have you considered fractional?\" Many haven't, but once they understand the model, they're intrigued.

I think as this market matures, we'll see more formal processes. Right now it's very relationship-driven."

One thing I'm seeing from my new vantage point as a fractional Chief Impact Officer: many organizations are realizing they need senior-level strategic thinking but can't justify a full-time executive role.

Companies exist within social ecosystems that enable their functioning through infrastructure, educated workforces, and legal frameworks.

The most enduring companies recognize they're civic participants with obligations extending beyond quarterly earnings. Their social license to operate isn't just nice-to-have, but fundamentally intertwined with long-term viability.

Perhaps we should focus less on making the business case for social impact (though I'm deeply familiar with the many ways to do that), and more on reimagining what legitimate business success looks like in the first place."

Picture having a window open on a cool day - you can crank that thermostat way up without overheating the room. But if the window is closed? Things get uncomfortably hot real quick.

The social climate works the same way. When society's \"window\" is open to certain conversations, you can dial up the heat on those issues substantially. When it's closed, even a slight temperature increase can trigger resistance. Developing this intuition is crucial - noticing when senior leaders start fanning themselves is your cue that you might be approaching the limit for that moment. The art is keeping it warm enough for growth without triggering the organizational equivalent of throwing the breaker."

For me, courage to accept risk comes from internal and external sources. Internally, there's that fire in the belly - a conviction I've learned to channel constructively. This requires awareness of when that fire serves justice versus when it might become destructive. I feel the truth in my body, and it physically weighs on me to hold it in.

Externally, my responsibility correlates with privilege - not just financial stability, but also emotional resilience and support networks to weather pushback. 

Then there's agency - enough influence that your courage might actually move the needle.

When I examine these factors in my life, I recognize my high responsibility to lead and try not to shirk that call.

Perhaps most importantly, I believe something bigger than us is bending the moral arc toward justice. This faith gives me confidence that doing what's right, even when painful short-term, aligns with how things should unfold.

Since it's a game we invented, not a force of nature, where are the greatest points of leverage to nudge the system toward moral outcomes? During eras when our institutions are letting capitalism run unchecked and government's role as counterweight is shrinking, I'm starting to believe our energy is best spent building new models that show a different way is possible - protected spaces where we can grow something better, proving there are alternatives to a system that puts profits over people. Sounds like you're landing in a similar place."

You know, I've always led with hard truths - but over the years I've learned (especially watching masters like you) there's this delicate dance with truth-telling. Go too light and we're just painting over problems that'll come back to haunt us. Go too heavy and we end up hurting and alienating the people we're trying to reach. It's really an art form, finding that sweet spot where truth can support justice but also open hearts instead of closing them."

One thing I didn't have space to write up here but thought a lot about is how different sources of capital that fund activity in the underground shape what it becomes. I've been thinking about the church offerings that funded the early stages of the civil rights movement, or the union dues that funded the labor movement. I wonder if our current spaces for building alternative models are too tied up in national foundations and other institutions invested in the current power structure to create true spaces of independent creativity and imagination. This seems to be especially true in education. And I wonder if the eventual commercialization of hip hop happened because traditional sources of capital started pouring in and changing the incentives."

Learning business acumen is a bit like learning jazz. While you can study music theory and practice scales, becoming a great musician requires playing with others and developing your ear through real experience. Similarly, while you can learn business fundamentals through study, most business acumen comes from hands-on experience working alongside seasoned practitioners.

That said, I suggest starting with Clay Christensen's \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" The book uses his business theories to offer guidelines for finding meaning, giving you both an introduction to his business thinking and powerful life lessons. His Harvard Business School course \"Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise\" was formative for me - the theories help you understand the root causes of challenges that business leaders face.

Your practical experience, combined with studying frameworks that help you drive even more value, will help develop the pattern recognition and judgment that defines true business acumen."

Many professionals across both sectors develop similar management capabilities. Like learning to drive a car, you develop skills in handling the vehicle - leading teams, executing projects, setting goals. But business and social impact acumen are about knowing how to navigate to fundamentally different destinations. Business acumen requires deep understanding of how to create and capture value that customers will pay for, while social sector acumen requires mastery of both driving outcomes for communities in need and engaging donors who fund the work.

I find myself having to intentionally shift mindsets between my nonprofit and for-profit work - what seems an obvious decision in one context often becomes the opposite in the other. We might decline highly impactful activities in the for-profit context if consumers won't pay for them, while those same activities could drive both social impact and donor engagement in the nonprofit space. Companies often undervalue this social impact expertise, though we should push back on that bias."

We need thoughtful gardeners planting good seeds everywhere, especially in places experiencing growing pains around equity and belonging. But those gardeners deserve to go in eyes wide open, knowing what they're up against and ready for the challenge. I often wish these roles came with \"nutrition labels\" that helped folks understand where they'll feel the most strain if they're committed to doing the work of centering folks at the bottom of the social hierarchy. All these roles require significant character, patience, and resolve, but some more than others."

Addo From my experience inside these companies, I've observed two key dynamics: Companies respond powerfully to the prospect of regulation or taxation - it's why they employ armies of professionals to avoid both. And real change (versus window dressing) happens when they empower people with lived experience for whom these issues are personal. There's also the role of consumer sentiment, but it cuts many ways and can be slippery.

I'm working on a longer piece about how internal change agents can transform institutions from within. Spoiler alert: it's incredibly hard. Follow me for more on reimagining corporate responsibility in ways that create lasting impact soon."

What does it mean when companies like Meta delegate the work of addressing systemic inequities to the institutions that precede them - knowing those very institutions have historically excluded people at the bottom of our social hierarchy? \"Serving everyone\" becomes a way to outsource responsibility while maintaining progressive rhetoric."

When the founders declared \"all men are created equal,\" they meant only white, property-owning men. When companies today speak of \"serving everyone,\" it's important to consider what exclusions might lurk beneath such universal language.

Perhaps there's a deeper invitation here: to imagine what truly serving all could mean - not as comfortable rhetoric, but as a revolutionary commitment to honor each person's full humanity. The path forward requires us to both acknowledge how \"all\" has been weaponized and still dare to dream of its true promise."

I wonder though - how meaningful can the legal risk really be when many of these programs never had the quotas that critics claim? At least at Google, I never encountered the hiring quotas that are now being cited as legal exposure, and I contributed to a lot of executive level DEI initiatives. Perhaps what we're witnessing isn't companies waking up to legal risk, but institutions finding comfortable justifications for retreat?"

The question of when to exit the system is such a profound one, and it’s something I’ve wrestled with myself throughout my career.

One of the greatest temptations in this work is to martyr oneself—to leave as a statement or to keep fighting battles that lead to burnout rather than meaningful progress. Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning has been a guiding light for me in those moments. He writes about finding purpose in suffering, and that reflection often gave me the resolve to stay, to cultivate the internal capacity to endure setbacks, and to focus on the long, hard work of creating change from within.

That said, suffering for suffering’s sake isn’t the goal. If the environment overwhelms you or progress becomes impossible, leaving isn’t a failure—it’s a strategy. I’ve found that it’s about balance: staying only if you can still move the needle and grow through the challenges. There’s no shame in stepping away to spend your energy and talents elsewhere if the system resists all efforts for meaningful change."

Thank you! Absolutely—there are situations where talent or product can be more valuable than money, but the real magic happens when you combine them. Nonprofits need cash—it’s like fuel for the car. But when you add talent or product, you’re not just filling the tank—you’re helping to build or enhance the car itself.

For example, at the Equal Justice Initiative, cash supported the National Memorial to Peace and Justice, but pairing that with creative talent brought the Lynching in America project to life, from the website to documentary content to interactive tools. These combinations are where real impact starts.

That said, the tensions in corporate social impact apply no matter the resources—navigating them is always part of the work."

Separating role from self is one of the hardest parts of leading in these tensions. Companies/foundations often leverage your personal identity when it’s convenient and then turn it against you when critiques arise.

The roles we play in advancing social impact—whether as leaders, advocates, or connectors—are not the totality of who we are, even when the work feels deeply personal. Recognizing this can provide resilience. It allows us to respond constructively to challenges aimed at our roles without internalizing them as reflections of our worth. This is especially important when navigating emotionally charged issues where reactions can feel intensely personal.

As for re-traumatization, it often happens in environments where lived experience is tokenized rather than valued. When empowered with decision-making authority, lived experience becomes a strength, enabling you to align actions with what you know to be true. But in environments where it’s treated as symbolic, it can leave you excluded, devalued, and ultimately retraumatized. These environments are rarely healthy, and I do my best to avoid them when I can."
