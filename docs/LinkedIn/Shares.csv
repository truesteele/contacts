""""
""Foundations are visible. Their 990s are public. Many have websites. Our AI can see patterns and match nonprofits to funders who back similar work.""
""""
""Individual donors? They're mostly invisible.""
""""
""DAFs give them privacy and paralysis. $251 billion earning more in fees and returns than paying out in grants.""
""""
""After months of conversations with leaders who work with wealthy donors, a pattern emerged:""
""""
""Even motivated donors are making decisions in stolen moments, without the tools or time to evaluate opportunities well.""
""""
""So I came up with a concept: The Follow Button for Philanthropy""
""""
""Let donors follow trusted philanthropists. Like eToro for grants. Make whisper networks visible and unlock capital through proven bridges between communities.""
""""
""Then last week I took it to the Gates Foundation's AI for Giving Design Day hosted by my friend Andrew Dunckelman and his brilliant team. 30 leaders, 7 hours, one question: How might AI help donors give more, sooner?""
""""
""The room kept coming back to one insight: philanthropy's next wave isn't better discovery, it's trust distribution.""
""""
""Three things became clear:""
""""
""1) Trust scales through stories, not data alone. Two-minute founder videos outperform 20-page reports, but many of us are still over-indexing on text and facts.""
""""
""2) Trust flows through philanthropic and wealth advisors. They're the distribution channel. Center them, or you won't scale giving.""
""""
""3) Trusted algorithms require deliberate design—otherwise they miss the brilliance already alive in communities, surfacing whoever already looks polished and burying voices closest to the work.""
""""
""So where does that leave the Follow Button?""
""""
""The core insight holds. We need infrastructure that lets trust flow, not stay locked in individual relationships.""
""""
""But the mechanism was wrong. Wealthy donors don't follow other donors at scale. They trust their advisors.""
""""

I was lucky enough to bring my daughter Jaelyn, and 20 of her fellow middle schoolers from Oakland, California to Mark Rober’s CrunchLabs to kick off the project (egg drops, Nerf gun battles, and building ball launcher robotic kits with laser trip wires! https://lnkd.in/gSmizYq8). Mark is a NASA engineer turned YouTube creator who founded CrunchLabs to help young people “think like an engineer” through hands-on play with build-it-yourself STEM toys. What Mark emphasized to the kids throughout the event, and what stuck with me, is that thinking like an engineer doesn’t necessarily mean pursuing a certain degree or profession. It’s about having relentless curiosity and believing you can solve whatever problem you put your mind to. When I was a kid, that meant tinkering with the motorized engines in Capsela kits. Now, for Jaelyn, it means understanding how AI can help her engineer a better robot. Big shout out to Hannah Peter, Jane Woodall, and Adrian Schurr for all their hard work to bring this partnership to life. ""
