We are preparing to publish data in Dallas Co., AL (Selma). We are working closely with them to learn more about what they need and there's only one priority -- reduce violence so that the young people of Selma can thrive.   Last Thursday I connected the D.A. with two of our criminologists to discuss the strategy models he is considering. As of February 27th, the city had already had 4 homicides. Three days later when we spoke again there'd been 2 more. Selma has a population of approx 17k.   I am sitting in all of these meetings and hearing D.A.'s across the country say the same thing: we are at risk of losing an entire generation of black men. I feel like we are in a state of emergency and my hands are tied. So close to impact, yet so far. Do you know of any holistic violence reduction roundtables or think tanks I can be a part of? I want to run toward the problem, but from where I sit I feel that my hands are tied. ",INBOX,

One Game. One World."" activation, an ArtTechVibe initiative designed for the 2026 World Cup in Seattle.  The Project: Our ""Unity Loop"" uses high-vibrancy physical murals to foster community resilience and equality. We aim to use Google’s ARCore Geospatial API and Geospatial Creator to anchor digital stories to Seattle’s ""King Street Crossing,"" allowing fans to experience immersive 3D content through their mobile browsers with sub-meter accuracy.  The Partnership Opportunity: We propose ArtTechVibe as a ""Cultural Landmark"" pilot to:  Automate World-Scale AR: Utilize Google’s Photorealistic 3D Tiles and Rooftop Anchors to make our murals permanent digital icons on Google Maps and Street View.  Cultural Preservation: Partner with Google Arts & Culture to archive Leslie Castañeda’s mural series as a permanent digital collection, ensuring the project’s ""Art with a Heart"" mission lives on after the tournament.  Inclusive Technology: Demonstrate a ""no-app-download"" AR experience that prioritizes digital accessibility for global visitors.  Commitment to Success: We have already secured a $32,575 community match in professional services and materials. We are looking for Google to provide the technical infrastructure and automation support to scale this project for the millions of fans expected in Seattle.  We look forward to discussing how we can integrate our site-specific AR models with Google’s latest geospatial innovations.  Best regards, Leslie Castañeda Founder ArtTechVibe",INBOX,

I was just reading James Hunter's book on Democracy and Solidarity today. Towards the end, he has no policy prescriptions, but he does have a set of principles he hopes can help us transform our democracy. Toughest among these, he estimates, is leadership. Here's what he says about it:  ""This kind of leadership would have to be prepared to be ignored, then dismissed as naive, and then despised by the main partisans who would ultimately see its exemplars as a threat to their interests. Such is the progression in any important paradigm shift. Invariably, reputation and livelihood would be at risk, but without putting such things at risk, leadership would lack credibility or authority.""  I'm so sorry to hear you're going through something similar at Genentech as what I went through a few months ago at Google. It rips your heart out. But, I think for those of us going through it, it's preparing us for leadership roles in helping our country find its way out of this hole. Experiences like this, I believe, are a prerequisite for the leaders to come. It humbles you in ways that are very necessary.  Yes, happy to connect. Here's a link to my calendar.

I’ll put my cards on the table and be a bit bold here. My role as lead for all of Genentech’s health equity giving was just eliminated. We can get into the details, but it’s a blow to the ego, a bummer for the company, and an opportunity to pivot.   I’d welcome a chance to connect if you’re open to it. Flexible on timing, etc. I feel like we may be like-minded advocates for racial equity as a business priority, with the receipts to show for it. And hoping to expand my network.   Elizabeth",INBOX,

Can't thank you enough for reaching out on our behalf.  I did chuckle a bit at the EBCF response. We did receive one small grant that happened to be paid from a fund housed there, but we sourced that ourselves through a direct relationship. Beyond that and filling out their intake form, nothing has come through despite warm relationships with several people there, including a major DAF holder who's been encouraging them to support outdoor equity work. I think they mean well, but for whatever reason we haven't been able to get traction.  Since you know the DAF world so well, any advice on how to turn those kinds of warm relationships into something real? I know the lines can be tricky to navigate and every foundation handles it differently.  Really appreciate you sending materials to your client too. Let me know how it goes.  And have you checked out our 2026 trip lineup? Some of them are going to be incredible. I hope you and your son will join us for one!

We put a lot of thought into ensuring that we create a culturally space safe for BIPOC families, and we also want to create bridges across class/culture/race. We've had several white families join us and fit right in, and knowing you and your values, I think you'd fit right in too. It's been a beautiful thing to watch folks connect in ways that are very hard outside of these kinds of intentional, public spaces.  And I totally hear you on the camping hang ups. As you can imagine, our families have all kinds of reasons why they've never camped or only done it once and never again. We often camp in campgrounds with showers, and we always bring our own shower with an on-demand hot water heater so that folks who want to shower every day can do that (and there are always a few!). We also have folks who bring white noise machines into their tents and any number of other sleep aids (heated blankets, etc.) to ensure they get a good night's rest. You'd be in good company feeling hesitant about whether you can actually be comfortable camping. We call what we do DIY glamping. We're working hard to make it work for everyone.  We're definitely in a relationship building phase with folks who want to come on this journey with us, and we're so grateful for any introductions to people who are interested in learning more and getting to know us. You know I know how funders/donors can be, so totally defer to you on how best to position it. Happy to wait until you get a signal there's interest, but also happy to make the time to share more with you if you want. Totally up to you.  Thanks again Lara!",INBOX,

I was just reading your entire website. All of it, and especially the “our story” page, is so moving. I have been following all your posts about this organization because, in addition to loving seeing people  start something unique and necessary, I am a huge nature nerd and former outdoor leader and always want everyone to love nature and feel its incredibly rejuvenating embrace - and because despite that, I actually hate camping! (am too light a sleeper to sleep well outside, can’t wake up well without a shower or at least a dip in a lake, etc) and also don’t have the gear - yet as a mom now, I know how much my kiddo (who is five and a fabulous hiking companion) would love camping so feel I need to get over my own feelings and just do it with him! Thus your posts inspire me to think about trying it. (And I’ll note that I would love to come on one of your trips but as a white person don’t want to encroach on such an important space of safety for other participants.) But because of my personal tug of war around whether/how to get my kid camping, I hadn’t thought about my ability in my current role to help you raise the funds for it until your post today! I do have a client with a focus on access to the outdoors for kids from under-represented backgrounds, and at MCF we have a few other clients with similar focuses; plus I just got connected to a philanthropic advisor at the east bay community foundation who has a client with this interest and specifically focused on the east bay. So I will hope that one of these folks will be interested in learning more! And could do a call with you about it first or wait and see if anyone expresses interest (as individual philanthropists are not always on the market for new grantees) so as not to unnecessarily take your time.

Your point about philanthropy needing to match the pace of product development really resonates. I love how you frame it as a second race that OpenAI is running.  We're aligned on so much, especially the need for equity commitments and the importance of internal buy-in. Interesting that you lean toward a separate foundation structure while I've seen the power of keeping philanthropy close to core business decision making (if you hire the right people who understand the company and the community!). Would love to explore that tension tomorrow.  Your 20/80 rule is spot on. Too many companies dilute impact by trying to be everything to everyone. And your advice to nonprofits about being grant ready is crucial. The organizations that can move at AI speed will win.  Looking forward to diving deeper tomorrow!",INBOX,

I'd like to personally invite you to join us for the Connected for Kids Launch Webinar on Thursday, November 13 at 1:00 pm ET.  Connected for Kids is a new national effort to align research, policy, and practice so that children experience connection, belonging, and opportunity wherever they live and learn. Led by Child Trends and the Thrive Center at Georgetown University, the initiative brings together leaders across education, health, youth development, mental health, and community development to co-create a shared roadmap for flourishing in the elementary years.  These “missing middle” years are a turning point. They carry early childhood investments forward and keep kids on track into adolescence, at a time when AI, social media, and isolation are reshaping childhood. The silos that fragment our work are not our fault, but we have the collective power to break them down. We can do more by doing it together. Connected for Kids is a roadmap to get there.  This webinar marks the beginning of a national effort to connect the dots between what we know from science and what children experience every day. You’ll hear from national leaders about how we can build a more connected, coordinated approach to help every child grow up healthy, supported, and full of possibility.

And if this mission resonates with you, please share the invitation with colleagues and partners who care deeply about children’s wellbeing.

I really appreciate the way you’re reimagining what technology and philanthropy can do together—building tools that actually serve the people doing the work on the ground.  I’d love to get you up to speed on a project I’m leading called Connected for Kids, in partnership with Child Trends and the Georgetown Thrive Center. We’re building a shared framework for flourishing that aligns policy, programs, and philanthropy around what kids truly need—belonging, curiosity, and connection.  Right now, the national conversation about children is split in two. One is about academics and test scores. The other is about sadness, loneliness, and mental health. But it really needs to be one conversation. As Jonathan Haidt notes in The Anxious Generation, disconnection erodes both wellbeing and learning—so we can’t separate them.  Our focus is the elementary years—the “missing middle” that carries early childhood investments forward and keeps kids on track into adolescence and beyond. The big swing is applying research to policy so everyone can work from the same playbook. We’re trying to build a movement—uniting schools, communities, and funders behind a shared North Star for what childhood should be.

Today, I'm also reaching out on behalf of myself and moderator Cassie Gruenstein to see if you'd be interested in speaking on a panel on 11/17 5-9p. at SV Bank office in SF on AI's role in Social Impact platforms?  The panel would likely start run 7:25-8:05p including Q&A. (Apologies for short notice - I just this past week cohered our thoughts on how we want to approach integrating in this topic in addition to other content that evening for the startup amd AI community).  More info at https://luma.com/63r2iseg, and I can give more detail on full content agenda and how we will connect the thread on integrity in commercial product as well as in social impact platforms.  Some of the questions Cassie and I though the panel would approach include:  * What's beneficial AI acceleration, and where assumptions and biases and bad data create distortions and hallucinations  * How any engineering team can approach products with a values mindset, in a way that can scale positive social impact beyond just the non-profit world?  * How to thread the needle on creating solid engineering products that are agnostic/usable of any policies, yet also ""make us make good choices"" in values and decisioning.  Let us know if you'd be interested, and we'll be in touch.  Best regards, Julie Tsai 650-400-8634 ",INBOX,

I am in deep admiration for all that you have done -- from google.org work and impact to your current passion project Kindora. Not only the product itself but the purpose behind it and how you are showing up for it -- including building and keeping it affordable / approachable by small to mid sized organizations.  I am an engineer at heart who has learnt to grow towards the power and impact of nonprofits in the world , so I am continuing to look at opportunities and ways to contribute and share with that nonprofit community. I am currently on the board for 2 nonprofits that are passionately focused on delivering non-traditional education to kids in school environment -- music (Living Jazz) and mindfulness (Mindful Life Project). I would be honored to get more insights from you on Kindora and or help in anyway that you might deem necessary. Your vision and mission for Kindora deeply resonates and hence I am going out of my introvert way to just send a note and share my heartfelt gratitude for your work and your journey. Keep shining that light and let me know if I can help broaden the light for the rest of the community.  With deep gratitude, Hardik",INBOX,

I hope things are going well for you!  I’m reaching out to you from my role on the Board of Directors at the Digital Harbor Foundation (DHF). As you may know, I actually started my career as a classroom teacher in Baltimore alongside DHF’s CEO, Andrew Coy. We reconnected a few years ago, and I was immediately impressed with the amazing work the Foundation was doing to advance digital equity, increase diversity in tech, and expand access to opportunity.  As DHF continues to grow, we're looking to bring on a few highly strategic leaders, and given your background, you immediately came to mind.  Even though our time at .Org only briefly overlapped, I spent years of my Google career admiring your leadership from afar, watching you balance business objectives with social impact objectives and holding up the mantle for social justice. You’re the kind of leader we need on our Board right now—one that can help us grow and optimize our impact while not losing sight of our vision of equity and access.  I was thrilled to nominate you, and our review committee is genuinely excited about the possibility of connecting with you about this opportunity.   We would love to find time to connect with you to talk more about joining the Digital Harbor Foundation Board.  Would you be open to a brief chat with some of our staff and board leadership?   Thanks so much, Justin.  -Kyle",INBOX,

I was looking at your work at Duolingo,  particularly Early Learners First. Having spent a decade directing corporate philanthropy at Google, I admire how you're investing in system-level change rather than just individual support. The business stabilization approach (strengthening childcare infrastructure rather than band-aid solutions) reflects the kind of strategic social impact work that's rare in corporate settings.  Since leaving Google last year, my co-founder and wife Sally and I started Outdoorithm Collective, working to combat isolation by making camping accessible to families historically underrepresented outdoors—particularly Black and Brown urban families. We've built a platform to help people plan outdoor adventures and are seeing solid engagement, but we know technology alone won't close the confidence gap.  We've been studying Duolingo's approach to turning complex skills into achievable actions while centering joy and inclusion. Would you be open to a brief conversation? We'd love your perspective on building confidence (not just knowledge) and creating belonging at scale.  No formal ask, just genuinely curious to learn from someone doing this work so well.

Seems like we're tackling the same problem from different angles. You're helping individual donors figure out where to give. At Kindora, I'm helping nonprofits (especially small and mid-sized ones) figure out how to reach those donors. But there's this huge gap in the middle. Donors can't see most nonprofits, and nonprofits can't reach most donors.  We've started to crack the foundation side with AI (public 990s and websites make that easier), but individual donors are a black box. I think a lot about this sitting on the San Francisco Foundation board where we manage $600M in DAFs. Would love to hear what you're learning about connecting the two sides.

Not sure if you were able to pull out some of these too:  Areas to Strengthen  Clarity on user acquisition.  You mention “500+ leases uploaded” as a key milestone, but how do small business owners find SafeSign? Consider adding a paragraph on outreach: merchant associations, chambers, city partners, or integration with existing legal aid intake forms.  Emphasize the “trust network” strategy — why SafeSign will be seen as safe enough to upload confidential leases.  Impact metrics.  Funders will want to see short- and long-term KPIs: e.g., leases analyzed, violations corrected, rent savings achieved, collective negotiations launched, or SB 1103 enforcement cases supported.  Suggest a one-page logic model or mini-dashboard visualization.  Competitive differentiation.  The “Incumbent’s Dilemma” section is strong; add a single table comparing SafeSign vs. CoStar, CompStak, and legal aid tools (e.g., JusticeText, LegalRobot). That will make the unfair advantage more tangible.  Technical credibility.  A brief mention of how AI parses leases (LLMs + supervised training + validation from attorneys) could reassure non-technical readers.  Add a note on data privacy and anonymization protocols — it’s both a risk and a selling point.  Tone & pacing.  The writing occasionally veers from brief to essay (e.g., long sentences in “The Hard Truth”). Tightening those paragraphs would give it more punch.  Consider a one-paragraph summary upfront that distills what SafeSign does, who it serves, and why now, before diving into narrative detail.  Visuals: Add a concept flow diagram showing the data flywheel or MVP feature stack.  Advisory bench: A short list of committed or target advisors (legal, AI, small business) would increase credibility.  Pilot partners: Listing 2–3 named organizations (e.g., Black Cultural Zone, Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center) strengthens early traction.",INBOX,

LinkedIn posted your latest post on my feed this morning. “From the trunk to the world” sounds dope! Also glad to see you orbiting with Christiaan Vorkink. I really like and appreciate him. Speaking of values-aligned folks, you came to mind because a few colleagues from Pittsburgh will be visiting the Bay Area, and I thought there could be some great cross-pollination of ideas and strategies.  Sally McCrady, President of the PNC Foundation, is a long-standing champion for children and caregivers through their $500M Grow Up Great program. She has been at PNC for many years and is considering what the next phase of their work could look like. I think she’d really value your perspective from your time at Google.  Cara Ciminillo is the Executive Director of Trying Together, an advocacy organization working to reshape childcare in Pennsylvania. They’ve been hit hard by federal cuts and are intrigued by your work on Kindora.  Ajoy Vase, is a good friend and former CZIer who spent a decade in the Bay before moving to Pittsburgh. He’s been in a post-philanthropy phase for the past five years and may have a few mutual connections from your philanthropy days.  I wanted to see if you might be open to joining me and this small group for an informal lunch or coffee in Oakland on 9/25 (maybe Paulista). Totally understand if the timing is too last-minute, but I thought it could be a fun and energizing conversation.  If 9/25 doesn’t work to connect with the group, let’s still find a time to connect one-on-one when the timing is better.  Thanks for considering it!  Abrazos, Jorge",INBOX,

I still think back to and reference your 2023 Socrates seminar ""Can We Imagine a Future Beyond Race?"" - particularly the idea of retiring from certain aspects of being Black that are entangled in struggles for power and ego. I appreciate that you created the space for that dialogue.  I'm now building something with my wife that explores broader themes of belonging and healing for folks of color. At Outdoorithm Collective, we create what you might call ""bridging spaces"" through wilderness camping - 72-hour experiences where urban families across race and class lines share tent stakes and camp stoves. When people have a tendency to believe our common societal structure has been created out of some natural order, the wilderness reminds us that the imagined thing is bound to feel uncomfortable.  We just completed our 10th trip this past weekend and are launching nationally. Families are already traveling from Cleveland, Dallas, and DC to join us for our trips in California. I've been using my engineering degree and Google experience to build technology to maintain these connections between trips and facilitate self-organizing.  Given your work on belonging and the Festival of the Diaspora's focus on fostering inclusive societies, I wonder if there are potential synergies to explore - whether through your network, upcoming summits, or connections to funders/communities passionate about innovative approaches to social cohesion.

I definitely remember you. You gave a killer talk at Autodesk. Wow, that feels like it was forever ago. Lots of life between then and now.  We currently use the Candid API for the tool, so we are just screening for funders who file form 990s, so nonprofit funders. We have done some initial research about data sources for individual donors (Wealth-X, etc.) and private investments (Crunchbase, etc.), but this data is all extremely expensive, and we're trying to keep these tools accessible for small nonprofits with leaders who are proximate to the problems they're solving. That said, we have our eye on other sources of capital, and if Kindora takes off, I'd imagine we'll start in on that front.  Happy to collaborate if you see opportunities!",INBOX,

Short question…  Are you open to explore what a well-integrated offshore team could actually take off your plate?  I'm pretty sure you already felt this...  You land a new client. The team’s excited. The scope looks great on paper.  But then the “real work” begins: Tier-1 tickets, client onboarding, 3AM pings, compliance checklists…  …and before long, your senior engineers are buried in things they were never hired to do.  That’s the hidden tax of growth in IT and cybersecurity. The more clients you win, the more your best people are pulled into work that kills margins and morale.  At All Sourcing Group, we help IT firms quietly build a trusted offshore bench, so routine support, monitoring, and admin stop slowing your team down.  We’ve helped dozens of IT firms, free up senior engineering time and scale 24/7 coverage,  who now run leaner ops, faster support, and tighter SLAs… without over-hiring or burning out core staff.  If I shared a short summary on how we could do the same for you, would you spare 5 mins to have a look?   Best,  Robinson",INBOX,

Love to hear it. Wandering Labs is the best. I just picked up a week at Lake Alpine in July from a cancellation :)  Would you be up for a catch up at some point in the next few weeks? No rush. I saw you attended the pluralism convening last week, and I've been talking to lots of folks about that space (including Daniel Stid, one of my former managers at Bridgespan!). I'm really curious about how to support and build more there. Our country desparately needs it.   I'm also wondering about whether some of the work emerging in outdoor spaces could really nail that theory of change. Folks who camp on public land are pretty much an even split between urban/rural/suburban. Half of folks out there make less than $50K a year, but there are a solid number of higher income folks too. It's predominantly white overall (80%), but new campers are 40% people of color. It's one of the few spaces left where there are genuine opportunities for building civic health across communities where folks can interact on equal footing and it hasn't been overly privatized. There also several collective impact projects considering coming to the Bay Area around this. One led by Children and Nature Network, another led by the Outdoor Foundation. I'm wondering whether we think we might be able to get corporate support from among our peers for something like that. I'm already working on the community foundations.  Anyways, lots of wonderings and dreaming. Would be fun to bounce some of it off you and hear what you think.",INBOX,

They're all awful. I dream about putting them all on a blockchain and overhauling everything. Maybe one day . . .   I think your plan is spot on, especially if you're looking for the 4th of July weekend. If you set up a Wandering Labs search for Wrights and Gerle Creek now, you will 100% get cancellation notifications between now and the 4th. They'll trickle in here or there for a few months and then pick up in June as you approach the date and people change their plans. If you see one you like, pick it up. If not, head to Utica! Another one I didn't mention because the sites are a little closer together and only a couple sites are on the water is Lake Alpine (West Shore), which is on the way to Utica. Might be worth setting up a notification there too. You could swing by on your way to Utica. If you like it stay, if not, head on down the road.  As a last resort, if you pull up to Utica and can't find a spot, iOverlander maps out wild camping spots that you can just pull up to.

I love this question—it’s exactly what Outdoorithm is designed to answer! Your query is the perfect test for our campsite matching tool, which we’re still developing. Since the UI is not ready yet, I ran your question myself and here’s the raw output. I’ve camped at Wrights Lake and Gerle Creek, and they’re fantastic. I haven’t camped at Utica Reservoir, but I’ve hiked near it and can confirm it’s pristine.  Wrights Lake Campground: This might be perfect for you! It’s tucked near the lake in the Sierra Nevadas, with peaceful non-motorized water for kayaking or fishing and forested hiking trails that lead into the Desolation Wilderness. If you’re up for it, you could even snag a backpacking permit for a night in the wilderness. It’s quiet, scenic, and offers some private spots—site 8 is the top pick (spacious and shaded by the lake), with 5 and 43 as other great options. Sites here offer some privacy but not as much as others.  Utica Reservoir: If you’re looking for a quiet, off-the-grid camping experience, Utica is a gem. It’s nestled in the Stanislaus National Forest, surrounded by granite outcrops, pine trees, and calm waters perfect for kayaking, fishing, or swimming. Campsites are all first-come, first-served, so plan to head out early—and your 4x4 will be essential for navigating the rough road. It’s a rugged, no-hookups kind of spot, but the views and tranquility make it unforgettable.  Gerle Creek Campground: Located in Eldorado National Forest, this spot is super peaceful, right on the banks of the Gerle Creek reservoir. There are no speedboats or jet skis—just calm water for swimming or canoeing. The sites are private, with great forested hiking trails nearby. It’s rustic (no showers or potable water), but since you’re self-sufficient, it’s a great fit! Best sites are 32 (most private, spacious, lake access) and 31 (lakefront, shaded), with 40 as a quiet, wooded retreat.  I’d also recommend checking out map.outdoorithm.com—filter for “Top-Rated” or “Recommended” and explore the Sierras. The whole area north of Lake Tahoe is dotted with nice off the grid spots. You can see historical weather data for summer to help plan your trip.   If you’re aiming for Wrights Lake or Gerle Creek, book now for July. Otherwise, Utica (or similar first-come, first-served spots) is a great alternative. I also use Wandering Labs to snag reservations from cancellations.  Let me know how this works for you, and feel free to share any feedback on the map or tools—we’re launching a big update soon!  Justin",INBOX,

Happy New Year! 🎊 I hope you are enjoying your new multi-hyphenated professional world. 🤩 I am sure you get this question 100x a day and point people to your website for campsite recommendations…..but I wanted to get your direct opinion if you have the time.  We are seeking a car camping spot that is not Lake Tahoe for 4 people this summer on the banks of a lake or river with privacy between tents, near by long, forested hiking trails, and within a 4 hour drive from here. We do not want to be near a lake with speed boats or jet skis….seeking more natural if possible.  We have a very capable 4x4 and are totally open to just heading out into the national forest and just being 100% self-sufficient. Any favorite recommendations?

Quick intro — I help professionals and families lower taxes, increase liquidity, and earn higher returns through my Tax Wealth Strategy™ — a personalized model designed to uncover smarter ways to grow and protect retirement savings.    Even with a plan or advisor already in place, many of my clients have still been able to:   • Cut their overall tax bill by using better rollover and income strategies   • Simplify RSU decisions to avoid tax surprises and keep more of what they’ve earned   • Rearrange their investments to access cash sooner and boost long-term returns    With almost 15 years of experience, I’ve analyzed hundreds of plans — and nearly every time, I find ways to reduce taxes, grow income, or uncover hidden financial gaps others missed.    A quick 30-minute second opinion might be all it takes to improve your strategy and move forward with more clarity — worst case, you leave with peace of mind; best case, we upgrade your entire plan.    Would you be open to a quick chat this week?  ",INBOX,

Hey, while I have you, I've been revving up the fundraising engine for Outdoorithm Collective (the nonprofit my wife Sally and I started), and given how quickly AI is advancing, I assumed there would be several tools that would quickly help me match our organization to funders in a highly customized way. But when I went out to test the tools (Candid, Instrumentl, etc.), they're all still using basic filtering and giving me lists of thousands of potential funders. The list is especially long because Outdoorithm sits at the intersection of inner well being, mental health, family and youth development, outdoor equity, collective spaces, etc.   Given how much I love developing with AI, I decided to just build myself a tool that embodies each of the funders on the list and then has them look at Outdoorithm Collective and make an informed decision about whether they'd want to fund it or not. It's allowed me to quickly get down a much shorter list of prospects that are truly values/geo/target population/funding size aligned.  Have you come across any tools out there like this? I'm trying not to reinvent the wheel here, and I figure smart, thoughtful founders like you would know!",INBOX,

Last month marked my 20th anniversary of moving to San Francisco. I’ll never forget the joy and awe I felt on move-in day, November 15, 2004, settling into my very own one-bedroom apartment in Cole Valley with a backyard ($900 per month rent!) and beginning my career in the nonprofit sector. From that moment, I knew this place was home. Twenty years later, the Bay Area is still my home, and I’m so thankful for the colleagues-turned-friends and this vibrant network that continues to inspire me every day.  A special thanks to Katherine Woo for joining forces to kick off this gathering two years ago - a space where impact-driven folks can come together every other month with no agenda, no pressure, just connection. The six gatherings we had this year brought me so much joy, and I’m already looking forward to what’s ahead in 2025.  To kick off the new year, I hope this makes our SF folks especially happy - we’re starting in the city! Save the date:  What: Social Impact Gathering When: Wednesday, February 5, 2025, 3:00 - 8:00 PM Where: Southern Pacific Brewing, 620 Treat Ave, San Francisco  Wishing you all joyful, restful moments amidst the holiday chaos! Can’t wait to see you in the new year.  Warmly, K  --------------------------------------  Background: For anyone new to this group, in 2023 we initiated this gathering to connect social impact enthusiasts in Marin. From there, it has grown to encompass the whole Bay Area (as well as social impact + sustainability friends who are in from out of town too!). We have friends here from the corporate social impact sector, sustainability/climate sector, nonprofit sector, and mission-driven intermediaries as well. Some of our regulars include friends from Salesforce, Airbnb, Kiva, IDEO.org, and many other great orgs.   Details: Typically we meet at The Junction in Mill Valley which has a tasty + simple menu of pizzas and salads, and we pull a few picnic tables together and people order and share and catch up. By design this is a no agenda hangout - really just a casual space to come together and catch up with this amazing network of badass social impact movers and shakers in the Bay Area.",INBOX,

We're definitely seeing a renewed appetite internally for justice oriented work. Yesterday we announced a $1M grant to Morehouse (https://www.msm.edu/RSSFeedArticles/2020/May/satcher-institute-receives-1m-google-grant-covid-19.php) alongside immediate relief support through Live Free's Masks for the People campaign and Hispanic Federation's COVID relief fund. Today we're standing up an internal giving campaign focused more directly on the violence we're seeing. The four orgs (all existing Google.org grantees) are the following:  Center for Policing Equity: CPE is a team of research scientists, race and equity experts, data virtuosos, and community trainers that partner with police departments to diagnose the roots of disparate policing in order to eliminate them.   Live Free: Live Free works to address gun violence and mass incarceration. They have also started a Masks for the People campaign to transform their national network of community organizers in the most marginalized black communities across the country and created their own PPE supply chain to distribute masks and sanitizer to essential workers.  Equal Justice Initiative: EJI challenges racial and economic injustice, provides legal representation to prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted of crimes, and protects basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society. Founded by celebrated civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson, EJI works to end mass incarceration and excessive punishment, stop the prosecution of children as adults, aid the mentally ill in the criminal justice system, confront the history of racial inequality in America and provide free legal services to the poor, incarcerated and condemned.  NAACP: The NAACP's #WeAreDoneDying campaign has been established to address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the Black community and combat the consistent mistreatment of African American communities long before there was a pandemic.",INBOX,

I came across the Outerverse initiative while researching blockchain applications for outdoor community building. We're exploring similar concepts (verified achievements, gear sharing, community membership) and I'd love to learn from your experience - both what worked and what didn't and what led to needing to shut it down.  Our approach combines tech innovation with real community impact - we've already hosted 200+ first-time campers through Outdoorithm Collective group trips. As an engineer turned social impact leader, I'm fascinated by the intersection of digital engagement and authentic outdoor experiences.  Would you be open to a brief call to share insights? I'd value your perspective as we navigate similar challenges in building trust and engagement in the outdoor community.  Best,  Justin",INBOX,

Over the past 15+ years, I have led complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives in international economic development—advising governments and multilateral partners such as the World Bank, IMF, and USAID on public financial management, inclusive service delivery, and governance reform. I’ve served in leadership roles directing large-scale technical assistance programs across Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia, with a focus on building civic trust and advancing equitable economic opportunity.  As I now seek to transition into a U.S.-based director-level role in the philanthropic and social impact sector, I am eager to contribute my strategic leadership experience, global perspective, and commitment to community empowerment. Your path—from Bain to Google.org to co-founding a public interest tech nonprofit—reflects the type of innovative, mission-aligned work I hope to pursue, and I would greatly appreciate any guidance you might be willing to share.  If your schedule permits, I would be grateful for the opportunity to connect for a brief 15–20 minute call at your convenience.

An alternative way to structure it might be to create an income-based student debt payment structure. That way, you could forgive the debt if necessary. You would need to work with a lawyer to determine any legal risks on CT’s side and the tax implications for the learner if you discharge the debt.  Education is not my field, but I have been working in it increasingly, with Learn Capital on an upcoming journal article and some other projets.  Hope this helps, Dan",INBOX,

My personal journey in workforce development spans from leading programs at Year Up to most recently directing over half a billion dollars in philanthropy at Google.org, including the creation of the $100M Google Career Certificates Fund. This work has shown me repeatedly: when we remove financial obstacles, talented people thrive.  We've identified an important opportunity at Coding Temple: while 9,000+ applicants annually demonstrate the technical aptitude to succeed in our program, 87% cannot enroll due to financial constraints, with 78% of these qualified non-enrolling applicants coming from underrepresented backgrounds. Here in Chicago specifically, we're seeing these same patterns, with talented individuals unable to access transformative education despite having the skills to succeed.  I'm particularly impressed by Boeing's commitment to ""inspiring tomorrow's innovators"" through your community investment approach. The technical skills we teach directly complement the STEM talent pipeline that companies like Boeing have been cultivating in Chicago for years.  Would you be open to a brief conversation about how Boeing and Coding Temple Foundation could partner to expand access to transformative tech education for Chicago residents? I'd welcome the chance to share more about our approach, hear more about your workforce development priorities within Boeing's community strategy, and explore where our goals might align.

I'm now serving as a fractional Chief Impact Officer at Coding Temple Foundation, where we're tackling financial barriers that prevent qualified BIPOC candidates from accessing tech education pathways.  Your work at Lumina on employer-aligned programs caught my attention while researching potential approaches to scale our impact. I particularly appreciated your insights on DEI's critical role in workforce partnerships.  Given our parallel work in education-to-employment systems, I'd value connecting to compare notes as fellow practitioners in this space. There's much we could learn from each other's approaches to credential pathways and employer engagement strategies.  Would you be open to a brief conversation in the coming weeks?

Unsurprisingly, 78% of these qualified non-enrolling applicants come from BIPOC backgrounds.  For those who complete our program, we see 85% job placement with average starting salaries of $70-80K, and our experiential learning component has helped accelerate placement significantly.  I understand Microsoft has previously supported Coding Temple through Nisaini Rivera's team, and I'm curious if you might be open to exploring whether there are additional ways Microsoft and Coding Temple Foundation could work together to address these financial barriers to tech education?

So great to hear your family loves camping. Many of our friends in Oakland first started asking us about camping because our kids' public schools take the students on camping trips. Families kept hearing about their kids' amazing experiences but weren't sure how to replicate it as a family, and that became part of our inspiration for Outdoorithm Collective.  We've always been campers, but we kicked things up a notch during COVID when we bought a little Mercedes Metris campervan and started getting out 30–40 nights a year with our girls. It's been an incredible way to reconnect and explore.  Your summer plans sound awesome—definitely keep us posted when you're in California! We're actually hosting a group camping trip at Humboldt Redwoods State Park over the 4th of July weekend if you happen to be in the area then, expecting around 60 folks. It's set among beautiful old-growth redwoods and along the Eel River—should be an amazing gathering. But either way, let's stay in touch; we’re often out camping multiple weekends each month, especially during summer, even if our teenagers occasionally need extra coaxing!  Also, if it’s helpful for your planning, we created a sister tech platform, www.outdoorithm.com, designed to simplify the logistics of camping. There's an interactive campground map (map.outdoorithm.com) featuring sentiment analysis of public campgrounds, historical weather data, forecasts, and soon some new AI-powered tools we're excited to launch. Our vision is that revenue from the tech platform could someday sustainably fund Outdoorithm Collective.  Looking forward to connecting more!  Warmly,  Justin",INBOX,

It’s more like… I’ve been sitting with this question of “Why do I still feel so lost?”  Part of me keeps thinking maybe I just need to try harder. But even when I do, that lost feeling doesn’t really go away. And I’ve noticed I’m not alone — a lot of the people I’ve connected with from the software engineering track seem to be in the same boat. It feels like there’s plenty of opportunity to practice job searching, but not much traction when it comes to real interviews.  I imagined when signing up a defined path — like a curated job board with partner companies, or active recruiting efforts. Maybe that’s not a thing anymore? I don’t know. What I do know is that while I love the alumni community — because they’re just like me in many ways — we’re all kind of flopping around in what feels like a drying-up lakebed. And I’m sitting here thinking: we need some rain.  I'm trying to use my experience to refine what types of roles I should actually be going for, and ideally tailor my resume for each — but there’s only one resume slot available on Prentus, which makes that harder. So I’m doing my best to keep moving, but yeah — I could really use some direction and there hasnt been a solid answer.   In short, yeah, career support has kinda felt like binge watching a YouTube playlist called “How to Get a Job in Tech (but Without the Job Part).”   Thanks for hearing me out — I appreciate the space to be honest about it.

To clarify, my intention wasn’t to single out one experience but rather to shine a light on a pattern I’ve noticed across several individuals I’ve connected with — people who’ve gone through similar programs and come out feeling somewhat adrift. I’m speaking both from my own experience and from the stories I’ve heard from others along the way.  Personally, I’ve had positive interactions with fellow alumni, and that peer network has been one of the strongest aspects of the journey. However, from the corporate side, I sometimes felt like just another number — promised a transformative experience but left without the follow-through needed to succeed in today’s job market.  I understand that analytics and success metrics can be hard to measure precisely — especially in something as human as career transitions — but the often-quoted “85% success rate” hasn’t matched what I’ve seen or felt on the ground. Once the program ended, I expected there to be a stronger bridge into real job opportunities. Instead, I was handed a premium LinkedIn tool, which felt more like a placeholder than a solution — especially in a job market that’s shifting daily due to tech layoffs, emerging trends like “vibe hiring,” and the rise of non-traditional pathways.  When I brought this up to a job coach, their advice was to “start a YouTube channel.” At that point, I couldn’t help but think: for the investment made, I could’ve built one hell of a channel already.  I’m not trying to be cynical — I’m reaching out because I care. I’m passionate about tech, about growth, and about finding meaningful work. I still believe in the mission. I just think there’s a gap between what’s promised and what’s actually delivered, and I’m hoping there’s room to bridge that — together.  Thanks again for hearing me out.  Best, Jose",INBOX,

Now shut that window and open the spreadsheets. Because these students don’t need another TED Talk about economic mobility. They need you to dissect every promise this company made, find the ones that were traps, and start cutting dead weight.  2. Stop listening to the applause. All those “Congrats Justin!” comments? They’re resume padding. If you want real credibility, go talk to the students still jobless after 9 months. You know—the ones not posting, because they’re too burned out to play the algorithm game.  3. Make lies expensive. If Coding Temple is still using inflated placement stats, burying refund denials in fine print, or pushing students to become unpaid brand reps through “building in public,” shut it down. Publicly. Immediately. Because otherwise, you're just the fresh paint on a collapsing wall.  4. Don’t hide behind “impact.” You don’t need to ""reimagine pathways to mobility""—you need to give people what they paid for: jobs or their damn money back. Skip the vision boards. Start with:  Refund audits  Verified placement numbers  Stopping extensions from voiding guarantees  Actually helping, not spinning   5. Fire the funnel. If the only people getting hired are getting hired by Coding Temple, it’s not a career pipeline—it’s a human centipede of desperation. Stop turning students into staff just to pad outcomes. They’re not success stories. They’re survivors.  6. Own it or bounce. You’re not here to “advise” politely while sipping sparkling water. You’re here to blow the doors open, fix the broken trust, and stop the emotional debt people carry on top of their student loans. If you can’t do that with full power? Don’t let them use your name.

I led Google's largest philanthropy team for the past decade and am always inspired seeing other corporate leaders find innovative ways to make impact.   My wife Sally and I founded Outdoorithm Collective last year here in Oakland, inspired by our own camping trips with our four girls, to help urban families discover the same joy we found in nature when we started backpacking together in 2005 (fueled by many, many Clif Bars!).  Your personal story of finding community in America deeply resonates. We're seeing similar transformative connections happen when diverse families camp together on public lands - people finding belonging, healing, and purpose.  We've hosted seven group trips so far, creating over 11,500 hours of outdoor experiences for urban families who might never have accessed these spaces otherwise. The transformation has been so meaningful - children climbing trees without fear, parents experiencing restorative sleep, families developing their own outdoor traditions that honor their cultural heritage.  Sally and I would love to grab coffee or jump on a call and share stories about our work creating inclusive outdoor spaces where environmental stewardship and community health naturally intersect.  No agenda beyond genuine connection between East Bay neighbors doing aligned work. Worth exploring?  All the best,  Justin",INBOX,

Then, you could prompt Claude to fill in a new RFP, and it would reference all your project files to do so.  The team at VITAL (https://www.thevital.co/) are excellent closers, particularly Bryan.

It’s been a minute. Trusting you’re doing well. Justin do you know anyone I can consult with to assist me with finishing setting up Google workspace with Gemini. My goal is to place all of my previous requests for proposal responses in it along with a couple of very large competitor responses and allow AI to assist  E with strong responses. 75% of the same questions are typically asked so AI can use my prior answers and in some of the RFPs I refined the response but I don’t know which RFPs I did such in 🤦🏾‍♀️. Also it would be great to ask AI to refine the answers based in my responses, maybe adding competitor responses and whatever else it does. We have a template we use that has almost all of the standard answers and grab responses from those and then manually do a “control Find” to search in some of the RFPs. It’s just too tedious. Looking forward to your reply. Also if you know of any sales folks who are “closers” I’d love to speak with them. Thanks again and hate you couldn’t come on board to assist a small developing firm like ours😀.",INBOX,

I've been following Tom's work with the Get Into Nature initiative and your stewardship approach to environmental access.  We see a lot of overlap with Tom's commitment to reducing barriers to nature access and creating inclusive outdoor experiences. In just our first year, we've helped 178 participants (primarily BIPOC families) log over 11,500 hours outdoors through community-driven, culturally relevant programming that builds both environmental stewardship and stronger communities.  As you continue leading Tom's sustainability and social impact efforts, I'd value your perspective on our approach. We're especially interested in Tom's experience creating ethical, accessible pathways to nature while scaling environmental impact nationally.

Would you be ok to introduce me to a contact at google.org whom we can interview on the role AI can play in under served populations? Thank you, kind regards Kalpana",INBOX,

Given Jackery's impressive partnerships with WWF and the National Forest Foundation, I thought our missions might align. I recently left my role leading Google's Corporate Social Responsibility team to launch Outdoorithm Collective (www.outdoorithmcollective.org), an Oakland-based nonprofit getting families of color into camping through guided group trips. We're big Jackery fans - my family uses three of your batteries on every trip!  Would Jackery consider offering our nonprofit a group discount on 5-10 Jackery Explorer 600 Plus stations for our winter camping program? These would power fans for our propane heaters, making cold-weather camping accessible for first-time campers. We're scaling to serve tens of thousands of families of color in the coming years, and we'd love for these families to come to know and trust Jackery products as much as we do - advancing both our mission and Jackery's commitment to making green energy accessible to all.  Best regards,  Justin",INBOX,

Your work looks awesome, I’d love to learn more about it.  I’m getting in touch to ask if you might know someone in your network who would be interested in coming on board as a CEO and co-founder for VISION, the AI-powered personal transformation platform I’m building.  Below is a brief description, and I’ve attached a longer one for more details.  Thanks so much for your time!  All Best, JG  VISION – A Category-Defining Opportunity  Just as Notion disrupted note-taking and Figma transformed design, VISION is poised to define the category of structured personal growth.  Founded by J.G. Boccella, a musician and artist losing his sight to retinitis pigmentosa, VISION is an AI-powered personal transformation platform that harnesses the power of creativity, structured goal-setting, and neuroscience-based habit formation to help people unlock their full potential.  By integrating behavioral psychology, mindfulness techniques, and the science of learning, VISION transforms goal-setting from a passive process into a dynamic, personalized, and visually engaging experience that fuels long-term growth.  The Opportunity  We are looking for a seasoned entrepreneur who has successfully scaled and exited a company, or someone who has been an early employee at a successful startup, to help take VISION to the next level.  This is a co-founder-level opportunity for a visionary builder who thrives on:  •	Scaling an AI-powered product.  •	Defining a high-growth strategy.  •	Leading execution at the intersection of technology, personal development, creativity, and behavioral science.  •	Harnessing the brain science of learning to drive habit formation, goal achievement, and long-term personal growth.

Hang in there! There is definitely an element of luck and timing in any of these CSR roles. And yes, most companies undervalue social impact expertise. They assume folks can pick that up, but the business acumen they feel less confident about. I wish it were the other way around, but alas, that's been my experience. On my team, I hired for social impact expertise and taught the business acumen. But I was the outlier. You're not alone though. This is the normal journey for these roles.

Your article really resonated with me as I’ve been trying really hard to pivot into the private sector in the social impact field. It’s been a tough one. I’ve gone through last stages of interviews with companies like Bloomberg, Pfizer and Virgin. I always make it to the end but end up not getting the job!

My name is Mahmoud Jajah, and I have had the privilege of serving at the Ghana Embassy in Saudi Arabia, where I developed skills in diplomacy, international relations, and community outreach.

Through initiatives such as coding bootcamps, data science fellowships, and technology empowerment programs, we aim to create inclusive opportunities for underrepresented groups, with a strong emphasis on gender inclusivity in technology.

I wanted to give you an update on this text exchange from a couple years ago.  I took your advice and created a robust reading list that has truly strengthened my daily practice in People Development.  However, in 2017 I was asked to take on the fundraising side of our organization in addition to my other work, and so much of my People Development focus fell by the wayside.  In the months that I was distracted with fundraising and defining our regional development strategy, I discovered the George Washington University masters in Organizational Leadership and Learning.  It's surprisingly affordable and really interesting.  I figured that I needed to get my masters eventually, and this would be a good way to stay connected to the topic I love even when distracted by fundraising.  Anyway... I just wanted to let you know!  Your advice was so helpful for me and I feel that the reading I did for those two years have truly prepared me to kick butt in this degree.    Thank you for always selflessly supporting those around you and thank you for your advice.  I hope you and the family are well.... and I look forward to the opportunity when I might be able to repay your support and advice in some way!  Please don't hesitate to ask.  Roxy",INBOX,

So good to hear from you. In response to your question, I think lived/work experience is probably the best path to learning how to lead others and influence culture. Organizational behavior and psychology can certainly inform this, but most people studying in those programs are headed towards academic/consulting careers, not people in practice. The Harvard Kennedy School has a mid-career program that does allow flexibility to take a number of elective courses around leadership and organizing that would be relevant, but it's a big cost (both in terms of tuition and opportunity cost). I've found that practice plus reflection (with an occasional high quality institutional training) can be a great way to grow and learn.

I have been asking myself those nagging mid-30's questions of ""am I living my authentic life?"" and ""will I regret these choices in the future?""  As you know, these questions are particularly haunting as the time you spend at work is time NOT spent with your family.  I often think about how you would always pose the question about being (or not) your full authentic self... As I reflect on who I am, I know I care about making sure when people come to work they feel happy, effective and engaged.  I get to focus on culture building in my current role, but a lot of the operations work (budget, hiring, compliance, etc) tends to take up a lot of the time I would rather spend on culture and employee satisfaction.  I've realized that I'm most happy when I'm ensuring others feel happy.  My question to you is: do you think there is a master's degree I should pursue to help me continue to learn theories and techniques to build my expertise in this field?  Would that be an organizational leadership degree or something else? Or would you better suggest to continue diversifying my work experience and continuing to read on the topic?  You're someone I respect a lot and who I agree with on many levels.  I would truly appreciate your opinion here.  However, I understand you're immensely busy with work and your beautiful family, so if you can't get to this, no love lost.  Hope all is well, and I apologize again for making a request after so long a silence!  Roxy",INBOX,

To clarify, we had entire functions in the companies I worked in devoted to measuring brand and reputation lift. The Policy team rigorously tracked policymaker and other influencer engagement. The Comms team had dashboards measuring press hits and social media engagement. Our internal philanthropy team closely tracked senior exec engagement with our work. But there was very little infrastructure devoted to measuring social impact, and very few people up the chain asking for it.   Often there was a single FTE tracking outcomes reports from grantees, and typically their job was more to find good storytelling material than to ask hard questions about what social impact was being achieved. Ultimately, it rested upon us as individual grant makers to hold ourselves accountable for social impact and build measurement tracking into our grants. The business metrics were readily measured and easily available. The social impact metrics were hard to measure and not readily available. And if you can't manage what you don't measure, it made managing for social impact really tough, and mostly an exercise of self-discipline.  Hope that helps! I see you're involved in leading the Outdoor Diversity Alliance. My wife Sally and I co-founded both a social enterprise (Outdoorithm) and a nonprofit (Outdoorithm Collective) to support people who enjoy casual outdoor activities into becoming campers, particularly urban families of color in the case of our nonprofit work. Sally participated in the REI Embark program earlier this year. If you think there might be ways to advance some shared goals in the outdoor space together, we're up for a conversation!",INBOX,

I wanted to share this note. Happy to chat further and catch up!   Hope you and your family are staying safe and doing well.  I’m reaching out about the Aspen Institute’s Health Innovators Fellowship (HIF)—a truly unique program that inspires high-performing healthcare leaders across the U.S. to deepen their impact in solving our country’s most vexing social problems. Fellows are from sectors across the healthcare ecosystem and work in businesses, non-profits, government, and more. Each Fellow brings a different perspective but shares a commitment to improve U.S. health and health care. As a Fellow in the program, I can vouch that it’s been a transformative experience (or “among the most impactful experiences of my life”) that has challenged me to stretch myself to have more impact than I ever imagined. It has also provided me with both the tools and a community to support me and hold me accountable for my actions.   I share this program with you in the hopes that you and Google may be interested in learning about ways to get involved with the Fellowship. HIF is currently seeking new partnerships. Partners who provide financial support for the Fellowship have access to 100+ healthcare leaders in the industry as well as more than 3,000 entrepreneurial leaders from around the world who, like Health Fellows, are members of the Aspen Global Leadership Network. The Health Innovators Fellowship encourages its supporters to get to know and potentially collaborate with its Fellows on their work and the initiatives they undertake as part of the Fellowship.  If you are interested, I would like to set up a time to speak with you more about the program. I’d be happy to set up a brief introductory call for you to learn more. Attached to this note for your review is our HIF two-pager that provides more information on the Fellowship.     Thanks so much for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you soon.   My very best wishes, Jay",INBOX,

We are currently expanding our team of Financial Advisors and, I saw you have some great experience that could translate into potential success for a career with our firm.  I'm sure you’re probably thinking a Financial Advisor career is random given your background, but most people we hire are ""career changers""; individuals who are successful in another industry but may have hit a ceiling and are open to translating their skills elsewhere.  To give you an idea of the earning potential, first-year income ranges from $119,000- $120,000. The average income per advisor that’s been here over 5 years is $500,000, the top 25% is $1M, top 10% is $1.8M.  I would love to invite you to hop on a quick call to learn about the Financial Advisor opportunity to see if it sparks any interest. If so, what is the best phone number to reach you?

Your leadership at the Ballmer Group in promoting economic mobility and addressing systemic poverty has been genuinely inspiring. I am reaching out to share Exodus 2.0, a digital social innovation designed to foster decentralized, trust-free networks for mutual aid and cooperation.  Exodus 2.0 leverages a mathematically proven model of inevitable network growth (N(l) = k^l), creating scalable, inclusive systems that empower communities to collaborate directly without intermediaries. This approach aligns with the Ballmer Group's mission to address systemic social challenges through innovative solutions.  The project is ready for implementation and could be seamlessly integrated into existing technological ecosystems. Exodus 2.0 offers a transformative approach to advancing social equity by enabling direct cooperation and mutual aid at scale.  For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the attached documents:  Mathematical Inevitability of Exodus 2.0 – This document outlines the project's mathematical foundations and unique structural properties.

They're doing great work and have been a big help, but they don't do many camping trips (the gap we're trying to fill on the nonprofit side of Outdoorithm). My wife Sally joined Family Wellness Group online a while back but hasn't made it out to an event yet. It looks like an amazing group. Very cool to see you leading there.   We'd love to pick your brain about how Family Wellness Group came together, what make it successful, and whether you think there are folks who would want to try out camping. We're not quite ready to expand our group camping trips in a significant way, but we'd love to take on a few new folks, and we also just started receiving some grants that should help us begin to scale.

It seems we have several points of overlap, from HBS and Google to our Washington State roots. I currently lead the Americas Team at Google.org, but with the significant reorganization happening at Google, I’m exploring new opportunities after a decade of leading social impact initiatives.  In my current role, I’ve been leading one of Google’s major initiatives, the AI Opportunity Fund, across the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, where I focus on addressing the societal impacts of AI. In addition, I co-founded a social enterprise startup, Outdoorithm, where I’ve been building our tech stack using AI, with the goal of helping urban families access and enjoy the outdoors through camping. I have an engineering degree, and I’ve been applying that expertise extensively in our AI-driven solutions.  I’ve had such positive experiences using Claude (AI still feels like magic!), both through the API and web UI, and I believe Anthropic offers one of the strongest genAI tools, particularly for general coding. Your commitment to social responsibility, as reflected in the company’s Public Benefit Corporation status and responsible development, is also something I admire.  While I understand Anthropic may not yet have a dedicated social impact team, I would love to explore whether my background might align with any social impact partnerships or advocacy work you’re considering in this space.  Would you be open to connecting me with someone at Anthropic who might explore these possibilities further?  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Justin",INBOX,

Of course. Here's a slightly longer version with a couple of additional anecdotes. Feel free to edit.  I first met Mo when he launched my HBS Alumni Forum. I was so impressed by his impact on a new group and how quickly we made meaningful connections and began to help one another in meaningful ways. The structured process Mo implemented to bond a group of peers and help them identify ways they could support one another was so impactful that I still use many of the practices today in weekly team meetings and facilitated gatherings of community groups.  When I joined Google, I called upon Mo and Forum Resources Network to help us create a support community for our underrepresented employees. The impact was powerful and profoundly meaningful. We launched at the beginning of the pandemic and a time of uncertainty. With Mo’s help we launched 12 cohorts. Our team members met their cohorts virtually on Google Meet for two hours per month. These cohorts provided a rich environment for learning, growth, transformation and above all building meaningful relationships. Years later, I still run into participants who have stayed connected to these groups as a core part of their community of support.",INBOX,

Congratulations on this fantastic initiative! I just read about the incredible impact you are leading with the announcement of the commitment of $75 million to train one million Americans on essential AI skills. That is outstanding! As a former Marine and Veteran, my partner Fernando Snowden-Lorence (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-sl/) was super excited about the partnership you have with IVMF too.  In addition to the above, I was recently speaking with Fernando about his career and impact. And I mentioned you and your work at Google.org, as well as your previous impact at Year Up. I am sure you don't have a lot of time, and I know you must get asked a lot, but would you be able to spare a few minutes to chat with Fernando anytime this Spring/Summer about your career journey and current work? I think you two actually have a lot in common related to your professional interests and skills, as well as your unwavering commitment to partnerships and work that supports life-changing resources and impact for others (especially underrepresented youth and working professionals).   If you're able and interested in chatting with Fernando, please just let me know the best way to connect you two, and I will gladly do so. If not, no worries, as we respect your time. Congratulations to you and Sally as well on Outdoorithm - so cool (Fernando and I both camped with our families/friends when we were growing up and still talk about its impact on us today)!

Please keep me in mind if you come across any interesting roles. Appreciate your support, and look forward to catching up soon.",INBOX,

I would love to learn more about your path and how you have been enjoying your time at Google.  Post YU, I went to grad school at MIT after which I lived/worked in India and West Africa for three years conducting emergency response and urban planning work for a development consultancy firm with clients such as Gates, Rockefeller and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I just finished a year fellowship managing government agencies and family foundations to improve affordable housing delivery in Mexico and Colombia through the Center for Advanced Urbanism at MIT.   Am currently looking at where I can have most impact managing partnerships related to international development, education and social justice (in Boston, NY or SF). I would absolutely love the opportunity to chat with you (for no more than 30 minutes as I can only imagine how busy you must be!) in the next week or so.   Likewise, if there is anything I can help you with - please do let me know!  All my best! Kira (kiraintrator@gmail.com)",INBOX,

Any interest in learning more / meeting him?  I'd love to catch up in Sept and get your thoughts on some career stuff I'm thinking through too, especially around potentially making a career pivot into non profit leadership.   Let me know!  -------- Shane, It was great speaking with you the other day.  As I mentioned, PeopleJoy partners with nonprofit institutions to create equity-based, student debt management and relief strategies that address the gender and racial wealth gaps, provide financial and mental wellness, and attract and retain talent.  I started the company after I graduated from Harvard Business School and my wife graduated from medical school with over $400,000 in student loans.  With the recently announced Limited PSLF Waiver Opportunity, which expires on October 31, 2022, more nonprofit employees than ever are now eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. In the past 6 months alone, PeopleJoy has helped employees at these institutions receive over $2M in loan forgiveness.  We're getting some serious traction and are looking for advice on scaling within the nonprofit sector.   Given Google.org's expertise in the sector, I wanted to connect with Justin.  Thank you for offering to make an introduction!  Lastly, here is a link to a video testimonial from a CHOP attending we helped save $83,000 of student loan debt. https://share.vidyard.com/watch/fe4KyYVD1eu66BucRVU5vY?",INBOX,

I saw the announcement on Facebook and I know this must be an exciting (and hectic!) time for y'all.  I also wanted to reach out because I'm graduating next May from the MBA/MPP program, and am still interested in Policy@Google - particularly in Google.org. I know we'd chatted back when I was at the company, you'd mentioned some of the constraints (Google.org rarely has extra headcount, and it's helpful to have some sort of Policy background, etc). That being said, doing the joint degree has given me a lot more clarity in terms of where I can (and want to) add value, and Google.org is definitely a space of continued interest.  Would you have 15-20 minutes to chat in the coming weeks to catch up and chat about roles (even if they're not directly in your org)? I have an offer from Netflix that expires on November 3rd, but would love to come back to Google for the right type of role. Given that timeline, I was hoping to chat as soon as you're available - also understanding that you have a newborn, and family comes first.  -Nagela",INBOX,

I’m excited to see that you are now with Google, which was only brought up to me this week by a friend and fellow social entrepreneur who is also making waves (no pun intended) in youth skills training and employment.   @Carmina Bayombong is CEO and Co-Founder of InvestEd, an amazing social enterprise in the Philippines that is helping underserved students hurdle college and succeed in their careers — not an easy thing to do nowadays, with Covid-19 still at large! Their work is quite impressive, especially since there are very few social enterprises in the Philippines that can pull off what they do.   I know you oversee Google.org Americas, but an initial conversation with you or an appropriate colleague — might help kickstart a partnership.

I'm writing you to get some feedback and gauge an interest in participating in a program I'm helping ramp up.  Last year I launched a program for Softbank that aimed to train and deploy data scientist and AI engineers in Latin America.  We initially trained a cohort of 300 for the country of Colombia which led to a request from the country to train an additional 3000 this year.  This immediately got my gears turning around how we could do this in the US with an emphasis on the minority communities.  I'm currently finalizing cohorts in Detroit and Atlanta (i.e. my hometowns).  Given the current climate throughout the country I think it might be the right time to be more ambitious.    After a few conversations with my training partner and some leading tech and financial companies we've decided to launch Data Science for All - Empowerment.  The goal of this program is to train 10,000 people of color over the next 3 years in fields of Data Science, Machine Learning Coding, and AI engineering.  I'm attaching a detailed overview of the program.  Would love to get your feedback on the concept and any interest in participating.  Let me know if you have some time to chat this week or next week.  Thanks, TK _________________________________ Thomas K.

(I've also become good friends with Kate Gerwig and Meredith Jaremchuk, who always sing your praises.) I just passed my 5 year mark at Year Up and it reminded me of you. If you'd be willing, I'd love to find some time to catch up over video conference and hear about where your work has taken you since leaving Year Up, and to let you know where my own Year Up journey has taken me. I'd also be very grateful for any advice you might have for me on how to navigate my own career future. Looking forward to hopefully connecting soon. All the best, Stacey",INBOX,

I've declined all board requests since I joined Google, and for now, I think it's best I continue to do the same. But if there are one-off things I can do to support, let me know.

At first Opportunity Fund, the nonprofit CDFI, appeared outclassed by some of the Fortune 100 companies we also partnered with. But time and time again, Opportunity Fund has proven that they can out-execute and out-perform large public companies, while maintaining a mission-focus that reflects the best of what financial services can be. As a proud former Wells Fargo banker myself, I believe the bank will be similarly impressed with the impact and execution ability of Opportunity Fund. The LendingClub/Opportunity Fund partnership launched in 2016 as a first-of-its-kind, integrated fintech/CDFI online lending program. We began with a pilot focusing on the state of California and applicants through LendingClub who would otherwise be declined. It was such a success that we have expanded the program repeatedly, both in geographic and customer scope. To date, LendingClub’s partnership has helped Opportunity Fund originate more than 850 loans, totaling more than $28M, including 57% to entrepreneurs of color and 31% to women entrepreneurs. The program now operates in 45 states, serving a broader scope of credit profiles, thus also increasing the volume of small businesses served through Opportunity Fund. Small business owners who shop for a loan on LendingClub’s website are automatically run through Opportunity Fund’s credit box, using co-developed technology. Qualified applicants receive a seamless, automatic prequalified loan offer from Opportunity Fund. We believe this online loan offering is especially important as entrepreneurs of color are more likely to go online seeking loans than their white counterparts – over half of the loans funded through the LC / Opportunity Fund partnership have gone to entrepreneurs of color. Our partnership thus far has proven successful by combining LendingClub’s technology expertise with Opportunity Fund’s track record of community impact. This groundbreaking partnership will continue leveraging the strengths of each organization to drive scale at a whole new level through Opportunity Fund’s new strategic plan. We believe this partnership is a breakthrough program for building and sustaining the economic empowerment of diverse communities, and the success of small businesses everywhere. That’s one reason LendingClub is eager and enthusiastic to support Opportunity Fund’s Strategic Plan (2109-2023), and the Inclusive Lending Platform roadmap for national scale and long-term impact.”",INBOX,

I just got back from a week helping #CampFire relief efforts in Northern Califronia, where I connected with the ChicoStart tech incubator that has taken the lead with the Butte County Department of Education to outfit whatever space they can find to replace the 100+ classrooms that were lost in the fire with networking, devices, and to enable an e-learning platform for the almost 1000 High School students who are going to have to do remote class for the rest of the year.    Their top priority is to procur 3,500 Chromebooks to replace the ones that were destroyed as quickly as possible.  There is fundraising setup for this (total cost is estimated at $1M), but I’m reaching out to see if it might be possible to organize a discount for their purchase so they can get as much leverage as possible out of the precious funds they raise.  The needs for rebooting 100 classrooms are vast, and they don’t know exactly how much its going to take because frankly, no-one has had to do it before.

I would like to think that humans (and even corporations composed of humans) are more altruistic, but... I tend to be a bit idealistic. That being said, we have a couple of (amazing) corporate partners at Playworks, who are consistently reaching out to us desiring the types of engagement events that we can provide for their employees, giving project teams a bonding experience with their peers, along with the gratifying feeling of giving back. That was my original thought, but when I reflected a bit, I realized that although we offer an optimal experience, there are many other nonprofits which could fit the bill as well and ... would love to. Thus, the power disparity. Sigh...    I'm actually writing to you today, because our COO submitted a proposal in consideration for the Google Impact Challenge Grant, and within the grant, she erroneously stated that Playworks has a relationship with you (Justin Steele). She meant to state that we have a relationship with Justin Philips, who works in finance in Sunnyvale. He is a Silicon Valley Board member. She sent me a note, somewhat devastated about her error, and I advised her that I would reach out to you (and our Board member, Justin) and explain the mistake.  Our apologies.

I liked his authenticity and the fact that his lived experience is what caused him to create the organization. He created a chat bot to register police interactions after his partner was killed; he made the product out of the back of his car while homeless. The guy is committed and seems really genuine in his desire to collect good, balanced data on both sides of the issue. He's already a recipient of Google funds locally I believe and My Brother's Keeper, but I don't think he's connected in the California space. His product is all tech, so he is trying to get connected out there.   It is a bit tangential to your areas of interest, but I thought perhaps you may know where to direct him. If it is of interest, let me know, and I will connect you to him. If not, no worries.   I always try to help good people when I can, especially when their ideas are often seen as a bit on the fringe, and they need the support to raise them to their potential.  I hope all is very well. Miss you and Evan.  Cheers, Allison",INBOX,

Root & Rebound is a reentry legal resource center transforming lives across California by empowering individuals in reentry to thrive and succeed. We are lawyers and advocates, helping people navigate the challenges of collateral consequences and legal barriers post-involvement in the justice system through a model of public education, advocacy, and policy reform.   Root & Rebound has reached over 40,000 people to date through our programs and services because of our commitment to partnerships and cross-sector collaborations. Partners include government agencies, parole and probation officers, employers, directly impacted and currently incarcerated individuals, social workers, educators, and workforce development professionals, among others. As a result, our work intentionally convenes unlikely partners, creating cooperation between traditionally hostile communities to foster community cohesion, increase access to equal opportunity for people and communities impacted by incarceration.  I would  greatly appreciate the opportunity to tell you more. We are headquartered in Oakland, launching sites in LA and Fresno this year, and its an exciting time for us to connect!

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anyone else you work with who you think would be a good fit.  10 teams of youth social entrepreneurs from the Youth Hub Fellowship Program (a year-long social entrepreneurship training and co-working program) will present their proposals for social enterprises to create equity in low-income communities. Each team will be pitching to a panel of local community leaders for at least $1000 each in seed funding! You can watch a video of last year's program (https://vimeo.com/201100989), and you can read blog posts written by this years Youth Hub Fellows (http://unitedrootsoakland.org/blog/).   - Each youth team will deliver an 8 minute pitch presentation followed by a brief Q+A  - A panel of local community leaders will evaluate each team based on their pitch presentation as well as a complete business strategy, which will be received prior to the event.  - At the conclusion of the event, panelists will reveal if each team will receive $1,000 or if there are improvements that need to be made before funding can be received.",INBOX,

Congrats on focusing $11.5 M on Google's continued work on racial justice efforts! I just saw an article about it published just a few weeks ago.  I'm currently doing a 12 month Peace Corps stint in Ukraine with an NGO focused on HIV/AIDS.  I see there's a Google Ukraine office and so decided to  revisit the Google.org site.  I read a bit about the community grants available under ""Local Giving"".  How might I obtain more details about the community giving program (requirements, priority areas, formal inquiries, solicitation, deadlines, etc.). I've just been at the NGO a week now, but have ideas running through my head that I'll soon be solidifying.  Of course, they require funding so I started today by looking at this year's American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine member list. Google's country director is listed as Mr. Dmytro Sholomko, but I think Google.org is the right place to start, so that brought me and my initial questions to you!  Thanks, Justin!

I am participating in MLT this year, and wanted to connect with a few people with career paths that I was interested in learning more about.   I saw that you do social and economic work within the Tech industry (in a pretty large corporation!), and I wanted to learn more about the work you do, how you transitioned into that field, and how a business degree was able to help you. I am very interested in eventually doing work to help developing areas, but was also interested in tying it into working in the corporate atmosphere. I also was interested to hear more about your time at Bain, and why you transitioned into a different industry.  Would you be available anytime this week for a 20 minute conversation via phone?

I'm sorry I was unable to connect following yesterday's NCG workshop on race and philanthropy. I am moved by the increasing commitment by philanthropy to issues of racial justice and equity.   Your story about bringing Google to invest on issues of racial justice resonated with me. I am the Executive Director of the California Bar Foundation. Recently, I've moved my board to refine our mission strategy wherein our investments now are focused exclusively on increasing, diversity, equity and inclusion in the California justice system, as a matter of access to justice for all Californians. In effect, we are changing the narrative in the community around the lack of diversity to one which directly acknowledges the racial inequities in representation in the legal profession and in the justice system as matters of social justice. As with your experience, it has not been easy to move this organization to this place. The 35 statewide high level partners, general counsel and judges on the board are all at very different places in terms of their own racial consciousness in this area in a profession that is the least diverse in the country.  All of that is to say I appreciate that you pushed Google to invest in racial justice work. We've all got to use our positions in whichever industry, at whatever level of impact to advance the conversation. Like you, I am relatively new to philanthropy and am always looking to connect with like minded leaders of color. Our offices are based in San Francisco. Please let me know if you have the time to connect for coffee sometime.  Looking forward to it!  Sonia Gonzales sgonzales@calbarfoundation.org",INBOX,

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  Justin   Questions to ask yourself (in order of importance):  - Does your approach disrupt the equilibrium of an unsustainable and unjust system that leads to social and economic exclusion?  If you were to ramp down, would the change remain or disappear? - Is the project rooted in ""first principles,"" breaking from established wisdom, boiling down to fundamental truths, and rooted in invention and discovery? - Are you taking direct action by creating a new product or service that directly improves the lives of the socially and economically excluded? - Will key opinion formers and policymakers be more likely to view Google favorably as a result of a partnership? - Will the general public be more likely to believe that Google gives back to the community as a result of a partnership? - Will the organization be able to leverage Google in unique ways by collaborating with our teams and finding new ways to utilize our products/services?

To date, he has raised $500,000 with nearly 100 individual and organization recipients, both here in Tulare County and abroad to Dominican Republic & Uganda.   For over 3 years, I have worked as Mike’s Director of Production at iBaseballChannel.com, untold baseball stories directly from the pros. Along the way we created a Narrative, which then produced a Purpose, and now has put us on a Mission.  This mission combines our production skill with a character-building curriculum and hands-on outreach, creating positive influence for students via Major Leaguers. The content captured by us via each community visit would include a Road Show of the crew, stories from the Player-to-Player interaction and a motivating Player-to-Youth forum with a different professional guest and youth group each trip. Our focus is California due to its width of diversity and many kids without proper resources.   We currently have and receive by the day Letters of Support for this from former Major Leaguers, Educators/Supervisors, and representatives of Youth Baseball Organizations. The YESS Foundation itself has registered for Google for Nonprofits and we are interested to know the potential of partnering with Google.org to help empower our mission. Beginning with an impactful first-year production window, we feel there's true potential to create a positive, repeatable formula for character-building through the game and its personalities.   Thank you for your time, and we'd welcome any suggestions as to how we can further connect with Google.org. We recognize any partnership involves a process and simply put, we’d like the opportunity to be considered as a viable outlet for character building for students, powered by Google’s tools of connectivity, successful because of the wealth of Major League resources ready, willing and able to help.

I'm eager to show my drive and positive energy and to channel it in the organisation where help is most needed right now.    Thank you very much for considering my request.

I am writing to you to formally introduce myself: after about 10 years of IT and management consulting, I am now in a place where nonprofit sector and all things philanthropy are turning out to be of great interest to me! I have been working in the nonprofit sector for a few months now, right from pro bono strategy consulting for some of the local nonprofits to apple-sorting with the local food banks!  In parallel, I am also in the process of meeting with people and understanding more about how some of my consulting skills from for-profit days are transferable and what new frameworks and theories I will have to learn about.   I realize that you have gone through a path similar in your career, moving from strategy consulting for for-profit sector to now being involved in philanthropy. I was wondering if you would like to spend 30 minutes with me in near future to advise me about how you went about the change and give your suggestions. I am also keen on learning more about google.org and perhaps you could help me with that too.  I must add that a discussion with you will be very very valuable for me since you will be able to give me insights that are truly applicable and implementable for my background.

StreetIssue.org is radically different from many other homeless programmes in that it targets chronic homelessness (not just one offs) and is self sustainable.   Founded by a small team in San Francisco, StreetIssue is very loosely based on the subscription model of WorldVision, where individuals and family have the option to connect with the person they sponsor. StreetIssue is providing a number of products and services that the homeless themselves, or volunteers (for those unable) can sell on a subscription basis that provide substantial value to the sponsor/consumer. From that, the homeless earn their own right, be empowered, and self determined to make a regular income. We believe that by selling a $7 service product like a discount card, curated content (maybe their life story with updates), or other products will be attractive to most people. If a homeless person receives 300 sponsors, that will be enough for rent, food, and most basic needs.   We intend to work with existing service providers in the area to provide options when the homeless collect payment. We want to give them every opportunity to become better, more stable and healthy. We believe in intrinsic motivation over extrinsic motivation, so have no intention of forcing the homeless into services, but may only offer the service initially to those who are serious about change and are immediately capable. These first people in the programme can then become leaders and mentors for the next wave of people.  We believe this model is scalable globally, and intrinsically different from other solutions - as at its here for the long term.  If you choose not to help personally, please share this with others that may be interested, or our meetup!  http://www.meetup.com/StreetIssue-Long-term-incomes-for-the-homeless-SF/  Thanks so much Andy",INBOX,

When I first started thinking about Year Up, I was interested in volunteering, and the more I think about it, I would really like to explore the possibility of a career.  From looking over the Volunteer and Careers pages on Year Up's website, I see a couple places where I could add value but I guess I'd like to get a broader understanding of the different departments, how each branch/department operates, and just get your input and advice as someone who works inside the company.  I may end up learning more and see that I'd be better suited for Volunteer opportunities and that a full time job may not be the best fit for Year Up or myself.  But the opportunity to help others and be part of such an amazing organization is something I cannot pass up with out at least exploring the possible options.    Is there any chance you could be available for a few minutes to have a brief phone conversation and answer a few questions for me?  I can make myself available any time day or night at your convenience and would be happy to make a donation to Year Up in your name to thank you for your time.

I spend half my day networking, discussing hiring needs & company expectations with managers from companies across the Carolinas. The other half of my day, I review resumes, talk to candidates, prep them for interviews, & manage a team of recruiters who spend 100% of their days doing the same. As you can imagine, I understand the need and the difficulty that companies have finding dedicated, qualified candidates to fill increasingly demanding and technology-driven jobs.     As a professional in recruiting, I see how much value Year Up can add. That said, your business model was not what drew me to Year Up- I have been a mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters for 2 years. When I saw the Year Up alumni on 60 Minutes talking about how the program changed their lives, I saw my little brother, Obi. When I started spending time with him, he was a shy 11 yr old who struggled with school and didn't like speaking up to give his order to a waitress. Behind an introverted 11 yr old was the confident, energetic 13 yr old I see today. He smiles, cracks jokes, and orders extra honey mustard with literally every meal. The difference that can be made in someone’s life by giving a chance/investing time is absolutely unfathomable.The contributions on a micro level that can be made by becoming a Big Brother are unbelievable. I believe the work you do at Year Up is an incredible example of what can be done on a macro level.     I send this message because I want to know how I can get involved. I understand that you are probably a very busy person but I wanted to see if I could have a few minutes of your time to speak. Given my knowledge of recruiting, hiring, & networking + my personal connection to the mission of Year UP, I feel that I would be an asset to your organization and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to tell you why.

But I would like you to please look again.    Firstly, the group has grown even larger to over 34,000 members – despite being an exclusive ‘closed group’ that only admits high-level professionals. The Business Technology Forum is now well established as a top quality group for CEOs, CXOs, VPs, SVPs & senior business leaders and technology experts.    Secondly, the membership includes hundreds of directors, VPs and CXOs from blue chip businesses including Bank of America, GM, Vodafone, Cisco, Hitachi, Toyota. Telefonica and McDonalds. So there is a wide range of different views from around the world expressed within The Business Technology Forum.    Thirdly, we have received lots of generous praise from our 33,000+ members because we employ full-time professional moderators to ensure lots of high-value discussions.

Hope you and yours are well. Love seeing pics of your lovely family on Facebook. The kids are beautiful!  Just had a great conversation with Jay Banfield, the Bay Area ED of Year Up (but you knew that!). I've been doing some reflection on my career next steps; I've put partner promotion on hold while I explore opportunities more directly in the fields of youth and/or education, as it just feels like the right time for the shift. Jay mentioned that some of the national roles can be located in existing sites, and the National Director of the Million Person Model sounds like a tremendous opportunity.   Would love any thoughts you have about it...and just reconnect in general. The holiday party meeting maker just got sent out, and it always makes me remember that holiday party where I was pregnant with Harriet, sick as a dog, and you and Sally generously gave me a lift home. Harriet is now 6 and a half!  AGG",INBOX,

I reached out   through the HoosOnline system, but I figured I'd try you on LinkedIn as   well. I’m currently the Deputy Director for a social enterprise called Year   Up that works with urban young adults in a one-year IT training program   that provides a unique combination of hands-on technical and professional   skills, college credit and corporate internships.    I’m reaching out because we graduate 90 students from our program every six   months, and we are preparing for our next graduation in late July. I   recently read a Career Builder analytics report that showed General   Dynamics to be the number one employer for Computer Support Specialists in   the D.C. Metro area.    While we have existing partnerships with organizations like NASA, Freddie   Mac, and SAIC (just to name a few), we do not have a relationship with   General Dynamics.

Part of the reason Roger can ask these difficult questions is that he has a knack for building incredible rapport with the people around him.

I'm happy to help you get connected to some job opportunities.  This is a tough economy, but you have plenty of marketable skills.  I just accepted a job offer with Year Up (www.yearup.org) in their D.C. office after having worked in their national headquarters in Boston over the summer.  They work with urban young adults to get them connected to job opportunities and college.  It's a really phenomenal organization, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm going to connect you over email to a recruiting associate at Year Up to get you plugged in.  Tamika Lockhart (now Tamika Mason) from UVA also works at Year Up as a diversity coordinator and HR specialist, so I'll cc her as well.  If you could help them get plugged into some of your networks of color for some of their upcoming recruiting opportunities (those that would not be competitive with what your'e looking for), I think that would go a long way in demonstrating the kind of value you could add.  I will also forward you a couple job opportunities that have come through some of my grad school listservs.  I would also encourage you to check out CommonGood Careers (www.cgcareers.org) for postings.  Did you know Neela Pal at UVA?  She was in your class.

Your background caught my attention because of your prior consulting roles and engineering experience.    We have been retained by a boutique consulting firm with a strong 20-year track record, to find an engagement director for their expanding strategy consulting practice.

The ideal candidate will have an MBA with 1-5 years of consulting experience and 5-10 years total professional experience, both in operating roles and leading consulting engagements.     Our client's firm is entrepreneurial and collegial, less bureaucratic and rigid than many larger firms; their consultants truly enjoy the craft of problem-solving, and they are rewarded for individual performance. The virtual structure allows consultants to live where they choose, and travel to the client as needed. Naturally, the firm has attracted many alumni from top strategy firms and presents an outstanding long-term opportunity.     Perhaps you know someone - a former colleague or acquaintance - who might be interested in such an opportunity? If so, I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak with you further.

I appreciate and respect each of you very much, and this is why I am asking for your help.    As most of you know, I recently took a position with Teach for America in Jacksonville, FL.  As the MD,STO I basically function as the Deputy Director or Chief of Staff.  Aside from being attracted to the mission and the function, I took the job because the ED was someone who I found to be an incredible and inspirational leader.  Sadly for me, but great for her, she's recently been promoted to work on the national team.  This leaves us looking for an exceptional person to take her place.

Told in large part by Year Up students and graduates in their own words, this book shares the challenges of chasing the American dream when you’re stuck on the wrong side of the Opportunity Divide. I am optimistic about the book's potential to redefine our collective perceptions of urban young adults as economic assets, not social liabilities, and ensure we leverage their talents to fuel America’s prosperity in the 21st century.     I would greatly appreciate your support in making it a success. You can help most by purchasing a copy of the book, sharing a review on Amazon.com, and recommending the book on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

The 1st semester was a bit intense but I remembered the Comm-School being a pretty similar 2 year structure with the 1st semester being the worst so that certainly helped manage my expectations. As for socially, I got a bit of a pass from feeling that FOMO syndrome on all the social stuff going on since my husband and I were expecting our son right after 1st semester ended (we ended 12/16 and he was born 12/21 so perfect timing..lol), which I think helped take off a lot of the pressure to try to be at everything but my sectionmates often remind me that I won't get off that easy in the spring :-) All in all, it's been everything I had hoped for. Academics are obviously a huge piece of it but so was getting a bit of time off from work to spend a bit more time with family and welcome our newest addition so this way he'll be about a 1 1/2 before I have to go back to work full time. I'm recruiting for consulting -- mainly McKinsey & Bain. Coming from PwC and working in professional services, I just felt like there was still so much more to see there before narrowing down to a particular fuction / industry / company and I feel like consulting will give me the best opportunity to explore that. We're looking at Atlanta (probably our top choice), Boston, DC or other Southern offices for full-time. I know you did Bain / Atlanta so any insight you can provide there would be great. I've talked with several folks down there and a few wahoos but another perspective never hurts.    Also, I'd been meaning to reach out for awhile since an email that you sent to AASU re: a position at your company came across my inbox. I sent it along to a few sectionmates that I knew were looking for positions in that space so hopefully you heard back from a few people.    Send the family my best!    Emily    ",ARCHIVE,

I have very few contacts here and I've found that people (at least in my dept.) are not very receptive to being approached.    The bulk of my current time is spent building my current project. I plan to use the company to train college graduates in Oracle technology with the goal of eventually staffing them to projects. It's still very much in a preliminary stage but i envision being able to build a team of trained, clearable people that have the skills that government IT contracts require.Could this be something that would potentially be useful to your non profit (if not now maybe in the future?)     In any case i wish i could give you a more helpful answer. There is a guy i work with Brandy Dawkins, he's a senior technical guy on another project, he might be someone you could talk to that might be able to help guide you further. He's been here for about 7yrs and he knows a lot of people in SAIC. If you want i can have him call you.    ",ARCHIVE,
