## Thank-You Workflow

Speed matters. 82% of first-time donors never give again. A thank-you within 24 hours reinforces identity, empathy, and reward circuits while the warm glow is still active.

### Thank-You by Persona x Motivation Flag

| Persona | Motivation | Thank-You Frame | Channel |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Believer (139) | relationship (58) | "Means the world" — personal, warm, references shared history | text |
| Believer | mission_alignment (73) | "You're helping families come alive" — impact-centered | text |
| Believer | parental_empathy (3) | "You're showing up for families like Valencia's" — parental | text |
| Believer | justice_equity (5) | "This is what showing up looks like" — equity-affirming | text |
| Impact Professional (151) | mission_alignment (143) | "Your gift is building what public lands should have been" — systems framing | email |
| Impact Professional | justice_equity (8) | "Helping build what public lands should have been" — equity + systems | email |
| Network Peer (27) | mission_alignment (20) | "You're the kind of person who shows up" — identity-affirming | email |
| Network Peer | peer_identity (4) | "Means a lot coming from you" — peer validation | email |
| Network Peer | parental_empathy (2) | "You're showing up for families" — parental + peer | email |
| Network Peer | relationship (1) | "Means the world" — personal warmth | email |

**Key rule:** Identity-affirming language always. "You're the kind of person who shows up" > "Thank you for your generous gift."

### Thank-You Channel Summary

| Channel | Count | When to Use |
|:--|--:|:--|
| Text | 101 | Believers (close relationships), contacts with SMS history |
| Email | 216 | Impact Professionals, Network Peers, formal relationships |

*(25 List A thank-yous via personal_outreach + 292 List B-D via campaign_copy = 317 total)*

### Thank-You Template

> [Name] — this means the world. You're the kind of person who shows up for families like Valencia's, and that's exactly what you just did. Your gift is going toward our Pinnacles trip in May — 12 families, three days in the park. I'll send you a photo from the campfire.

## What We Don't Do

- **Manufacture urgency.** Joshua Tree on March 30 is real.
- **Over-polish.** Warm and slightly imperfect beats polished and hollow.
- **Cold-call anyone.** "Reply and we can talk" is the bridge.
- **Mix stories with statistics.** One family's story per email. Not "100+ families served."
- **Let donors "own" trips.** "I'll count you in" = joining a team, not buying a trip.
- **Compromise the experience.** Trips center the families. Donors are supporters, not guests.
