## Codebase Patterns
- DB connection: psycopg2 with `get_db_conn()`, DictCursor for row access
- CLI: argparse with --dry-run, --limit, test flags
- OpenAI: `responses.parse()` with pydantic models, `gpt-5-mini`, 150 workers
- Env vars: SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD, OPENAI_APIKEY, ZEROBOUNCE_API_KEY
- Progress: print every N contacts with elapsed/ETA
- Reference script: `discover_emails_v2.py` has EmailVerification pydantic model

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: US-001 — Domain Discovery Module
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** COMPLETE

**What was built:**
- Created `scripts/intelligence/find_emails.py` with full CLI structure
- `company_to_domains()` function with 3-tier lookup:
  1. Hardcoded map (80+ known companies incl. big tech, consulting, finance, universities)
  2. Prefix matching for subsidiaries (e.g., "Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business" → duke.edu)
  3. Generic fallback: strip suffixes, generate slug.com/.org/.io/.co variants
- DNS MX record check with caching (`check_mx()`) — 3s timeout, results cached in `_mx_cache`
- `--test-domains` CLI flag tests 10 sample contacts from DB

**Test results:**
- 10/10 contacts got domains (100% hit rate)
- Known companies resolved instantly (Google, Year Up, Datadog, Xero, TikTok)
- Generic fallback worked: "Next Step Living, Inc" → nextstepliving.com, nextstepliving.org
- Edge cases passed: empty strings, None, long names with descriptions, suffixes
- MX check took 0.4s for 14 unique domains (fast with caching)

**Key decisions:**
- 80+ entries in KNOWN_COMPANY_DOMAINS (much more than the 20+ minimum)
- MX cache avoids re-querying same domains across contacts
- Installed `dnspython` into .venv
- Placeholder stubs for --test-perms, --test-verify, --test-validate (future stories)
