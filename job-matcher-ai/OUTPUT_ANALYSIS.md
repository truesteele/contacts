### ❌ Critical Issues for Recruiters

#### 1. **Missing Contact Information**
**Problem**: No emails, phone numbers, or LinkedIn URLs
**Impact**: Recruiter can't take action immediately

**Current**:
```
1. Tony Emerson-Zetina, Ed.L.D ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Program Director, Crankstart Foundation | Oakland, CA
```

**Needed**:
```
1. Tony Emerson-Zetina, Ed.L.D ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   Program Director, Crankstart Foundation
   📍 Oakland, CA | 📧 tony@email.com | 🔗 linkedin.com/in/tony-emerson
```

#### 2. **Not Copy-Paste Friendly**
**Problem**: Markdown formatting breaks in email
**Impact**: Recruiter must manually reformat

**Issues**:
- Star emojis (⭐) may not display in all email clients
- Nested bullet points lose formatting
- Code blocks and special characters problematic

#### 3. **Too Much Commentary, Not Enough Facts**
**Problem**: "Why they're perfect" is subjective
**Impact**: Recruiter wants data to make own assessment

**Current**:
```
Why He's Perfect:
Data-informed strategy superpower: Self-describes data as his "superpower"
```

**Better**:
```
Experience:
• 5 years at Crankstart Foundation managing $50M portfolio
• Data tools: Stata, R, Python, Tableau
• Education: Ed.L.D, Harvard Graduate School of Education
```

#### 4. **Missing Quantitative Data**
**Problem**: No years of experience, team sizes, budget responsibility
**Impact**: Can't quickly assess seniority level

**Need**:
- Years in current role
- Years total experience
- Budget managed
- Team size led
- Specific accomplishments with metrics

#### 5. **No Immediate Talking Points**
**Problem**: Recruiter opening an email needs a hook
**Impact**: Generic outreach, lower response rates

**Need**:
- Mutual connections
- Recent accomplishments
- Shared interests/background
- Conversation starters
